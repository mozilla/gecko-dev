                 or zero-length. The implementation of this interface
                 may use the URL to help determine what sort of window

      @param aOpeningTab The TabParent that is trying to open this new chrome
                         window. Can be nullptr.
      @param cancel Return |true| to reject window creation. If true the
                    implementation has determined the window should not
                    be created at all. The caller should not default
                    to any possible backup scheme for creating the window.
