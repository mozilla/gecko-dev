   /**
   *  This service enables embedders to implement their own Print and Progress Dialogs.
   *  Each platform has a "base" or "basckstop" implementation of the service. The 
   *  service is automatically registered at start up.
   *
   *  Historically, platform toolkits with native dialogs have implemented them in the GFX layer
   *  Usually they were displayed when a new DeviceContextSpec specific to that platform
   *  was created.
   *
   *  Windows: The GFX layer no longers supports default toolkit behavior for displaying the 
   *           native Print Dialog.
   *           If an embedder implemented service returns any error code (other than NS_ERROR_ABORT)
   *           printing will terminate.
   *
   *           Returning NS_OK assumes that the PrintSettings object was correctly filled in and
   *           if it does not have valid fields for printer name, etc. it may also terminate.
   *
   *           Defaults for platform service:           
   *             showPrintDialog       - displays a native dialog
   *             showPageSetup         - displays a XUL dialog
   *             showProgress          - displays a XUL dialog
   *             showPrinterProperties - n/a
   *
   *           Summary for Windows Embedders:
   *             Stated once again: There is no "fallback" native platform support in GFX for the
   *             displaying of the native print dialog. The current default implementation for Windows
   *             display a native print dialog but a XUL-based progress dialog.
   *             If you wish to have a native progress dialog on Windows you will have to create and 
   *             register your own service.
   *  
   *             Note: The Windows version Mozilla implements this service which is 
   *                   automatically built and registered for you. You can use it as an example.
   *                   It is located at "mozilla/embedding/components/printingui/win". That service
   *                   is capable of displaying a native print dialog and a XUL progress dialog.
   *
   *             To fly your own dialog you may:
   *
   *              1) Implement this service to display at least the Print Dialog and a Print Progress Dialog
   *                 or you may implement just one of the dialogs and pass back NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
   *                 for any of the others.
   *
   *              2) For the Print Dialog:
   *                 You may stub out this service by having all the methods return NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
   *                 You can then fly you own dialog and then properly fill in the PrintSettings object
   *                 before calling nsIWebBrowserPrint's Print method. If you stub out this service  
   *                 you MUST set "printSilent" to true, if you do not, Printing will terminate and an 
   *                 error dialog will be displayed.
   *
   *  Mac: The GFX layer still supports default toolkit behavior for displaying the Print Dialog.
   *       If an embedder implemented service returns NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED for "showPrintDialog"
   *       The toolkit will display the native print dialog.
   *
   *       Defaults for platform service:           
   *       Mac OS9: showPrintDialog       - displays a native dialog
   *                showPageSetup         - displays a native dialog
   *                showProgress          - displays a XUL dialog
   *                showPrinterProperties - n/a
   *                
   *       Mac OSX: showPrintDialog       - displays a native dialog
   *                showPageSetup         - displays a native dialog
   *                showProgress          - not implemented (provided by OS)
   *                showPrinterProperties - n/a
   *                
   *  GTK: There are no native dialog for GTK.
   *
   *       Defaults for platform service:           
   *         showPrintDialog       - displays a XUL dialog
   *         showPageSetup         - displays a XUL dialog
   *         showProgress          - displays a XUL dialog
   *         showPrinterProperties - displays a XUL dialog
