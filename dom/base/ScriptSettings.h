// JS-implemented WebIDL presents an interesting situation with respect to the
// subject principal. A regular C++-implemented API can simply examine the
// compartment of the most-recently-executed script, and use that to infer the
// responsible party. However, JS-implemented APIs are run with system
// principal, and thus clobber the subject principal of the script that
// invoked the API. So we have to do some extra work to keep track of this
// information.
//
// We therefore implement the following behavior:
// * Each Script Settings Object has an optional WebIDL Caller Principal field.
//   This defaults to null.
// * When we push an Entry Point in preparation to run a JS-implemented WebIDL
//   callback, we grab the subject principal at the time of invocation, and
//   store that as the WebIDL Caller Principal.
// * When non-null, callers can query this principal from script via an API on
//   Components.utils.

 * For any interaction with JSAPI, an AutoJSAPI (or one of its subclasses)
 * must be on the stack.
 *
 * This base class should be instantiated as-is when the caller wants to use
 * JSAPI but doesn't expect to run script. Its current duties are as-follows:
 *
 * * Grabbing an appropriate JSContext, and, on the main thread, pushing it onto
 *   the JSContext stack.
 * * Entering a null compartment, so that the consumer is forced to select a
 *   compartment to enter before manipulating objects.
 *
 * Additionally, the following duties are planned, but not yet implemented:
 *
 * * De-poisoning the JSRuntime to allow manipulation of JSAPI. We can't
 *   actually implement this poisoning until all the JSContext pushing in the
 *   system goes through AutoJSAPI (see bug 951991). For now, this de-poisoning
 *   effectively corresponds to having a non-null cx on the stack.
 * * Reporting any exceptions left on the JSRuntime, unless the caller steals
 *   or silences them.
 * * Entering a JSAutoRequest. At present, this is handled by the cx pushing
 *   on the main thread, and by other code on workers. Depending on the order
 *   in which various cleanup lands, this may never be necessary, because
 *   JSAutoRequests may go away.
 *
 * In situations where the consumer expects to run script, AutoEntryScript
 * should be used, which does additional manipulation of the script settings
 * stack. In bug 991758, we'll add hard invariants to SpiderMonkey, such that
 * any attempt to run script without an AutoEntryScript on the stack will
 * fail. This prevents system code from accidentally triggering script
 * execution at inopportune moments via surreptitious getters and proxies.
