   * involved is in an inconsistent state.  This means that implementors of
   * this method MUST NOT do any of the following:
   * 1)  Modify the DOM in any way (e.g. setting attributes is a no-no).
   * 2)  Query any DOM properties that depend on layout (e.g. offset*
   *     properties).
   * 3)  Query any DOM properties that depend on style (e.g. computed style).
   * 4)  Query any DOM properties that depend on the current state of the DOM
   *     outside the "context" node (e.g. lengths of node lists).
   * 5)  [JavaScript implementations only] Access properties of any sort on any
   *     object without using XPCNativeWrapper (either explicitly or
   *     implicitly).  Due to various DOM0 things, this leads to item 4.
   * If you do any of these things in your shouldLoad implementation, expect
   * unpredictable behavior, possibly including crashes, content not showing
   * up, content showing up doubled, etc.  If you need to do any of the things
   * above, do them off timeout or event.
