This is a local copy of the WebGL conformance suite, version 1.0.1, SVN revision 17794 (on the 1.0.1 branch, not on trunk)

The canonical location for this 1.0.1 test suite is:

  https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/conformance-suites/1.0.1

The canonical location of the development tree is:

All files and directories in this directory, with the exceptions listed below, come from
upstream and should not be modified without corresponding upstream fixes and/or a
patch file in this directory. The exceptions (the Mozilla-specific files) are:
 * README.mozilla (this file)
 * failing_tests_*.txt
 * moz.build
 * writemanifest.py
 * *.patch files, if any

How to do an update:
 1. unapply local patches (the .patch files here)
 2. perform the update:
   * method A: apply diff with new version
   * method B: erase all files here, import copy of new version.
 3. edit CONFORMANCE_TEST_VERSION in test_webgl_conformance_test_suite.html. That's what
    determines with tests to run, as some tests are only enabled in some not-yet-released
    version.
 4. reapply local patches.
 5. update this readme and the .patch files.
 6. run writemanifest.py to update test manifest.
