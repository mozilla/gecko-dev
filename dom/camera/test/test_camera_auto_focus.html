/* Each discrete test case can be added to the test queue here.
   They won't be run until you call suite setup and run. */

  function startAutoFocusFail(p) {
    suite.hw.attach({
      autoFocus: function() {
        suite.hw.fireAutoFocusComplete(false);
      }
    });

      autoFocus: function() {
        throw SpecialPowers.Cr.NS_ERROR_FAILURE;
      }
    });

  }

  function rejectAutoFocusError(e) {
    ok(e.name === 'NS_ERROR_FAILURE', 'autoFocus() should fail: ' + e);
  }

  /* This is the promise chain which drives the test execution.

     suite.getCamera
       This returns a promise which is resolved when the suite
       acquires the camera object (i.e. returns as if one
       called cameraManager.getCamera() directly). It saves
       the CameraControl reference in suite.camera and will
       automatically release it for you when the test is
       completed.

     .then(startAutoFocusFail, suite.rejectGetCamera)
       If the getCamera promise is resolved, startAutoFocusFail
       will be called. That function attaches a handler to
       the camera test hardware to intercept the auto focus
       driver call so that we can change the behaviour to
       trigger an OnAutoFocusComplete(false) event. It then
       calls camera.autoFocus() and returns the promise for
       that camera call so that the next promise in the chain
       can block waiting for that promise to be fulfilled.

       If the getCamera promise is rejected,
       suite.rejectGetCamera will be called. This is a helper
       handler provided by the test suite; it will log
       a get camera failure and fail the test via ok, and
       return a new promise rejecting *without* an error
       object (i.e. promise parameter is undefined). This is
       important because all reject handlers further down
       the promise chain will still be called due to the
       failure. However since we replaced the promise with
       an error object, with a promise without one, we can
       use this to identify errors that have already been
       handled.

     .then(resolveAutoFocusFail, suite.rejectAutoFocus)
       If the suite.camera.autoFocus() promise is resolved,
       resolveAutoFocusFail will be called. That function
       simply verifies the result from the autoFocus() call.
       It should be false, given the modified behaviour we
       gave the driver. Since it doesn't return a new promise
       explicitly, it will generate a new promise which is
       already resolved (without the focused state parameter,
       will now be undefined to the next .then handler).

       If the suite.camera.autoFocus() promise is rejected,
       we want to fail the test case again, just like when
       suite.getCamera() failed.

    .then(startAutoFocusError)
       Assuming the first suite.camera.autoFocus() promise
       was resolved, startAutoFocusError will be called.
       That function is similar to startAutoFocusFail but
       now it throws an error in the intercepted auto focus
       driver call in order to trigger an OnUserError(kAutoFocus)
       event. It then calls and returns the promise from
       suite.camera.autoFocus().

    .then(suite.expectedRejectAutoFocus, rejectAutoFocusError)
       Now we are expecting the previous suite.camera.autoFocus()
       promise to be rejected, which would call
       rejectAutoFocusError. This simply verifies that we
       got the error we expected.

       If, on the other hand, it somehow succeeded, we
       let suite.expectedRejectAutoFocus handle it, which
       similar to the suite.rejectAutoFocus method, will
       fail and return an empty rejected promise.

    Note that this method itself returns the promise chain.
    This allows the test suite to 1) capture any unhandled
    errors in the promise chain and ensure the test case
    fails as a result, and 2) perform any cleanup operations
    such as resetting low memory state, releasing the camera,
    etc, before starting the next test.
