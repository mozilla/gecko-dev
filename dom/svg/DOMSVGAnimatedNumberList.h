 * Class DOMSVGAnimatedNumberList

 * This class is used to create the DOM tearoff objects that wrap internal
 * SVGAnimatedNumberList objects.
 *
 * See the architecture comment in DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList.h (that's
 * LENGTH list). The comment for that class largly applies to this one too
 * and will go a long way to helping you understand the architecture here.
 *
 * This class is strongly intertwined with DOMSVGNumberList and DOMSVGNumber.
 * Our DOMSVGNumberList base and anim vals are friends and take care of nulling
 * out our pointers to them when they die (making our pointers to them true
 * weak refs).
