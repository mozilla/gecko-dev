 * AutoplayPolicy is used to manage autoplay logic for all kinds of media,

 * Autoplay could be disable by setting the pref "media.autoplay.default"
 * to anything but nsIAutoplay::Allowed. Once user disables autoplay, media
 * could only be played if one of following conditions is true.
 * 1) Owner document is activated by user gestures
 *    We restrict user gestures to "mouse click", "keyboard press" and "touch".
 * 2) Muted media content or video without audio content.
 * 3) Document's origin has the "autoplay-media" permission.
