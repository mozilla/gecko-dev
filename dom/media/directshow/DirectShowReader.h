// Decoder backend for decoding MP3 using DirectShow. DirectShow operates as
// a filter graph. The basic design of the DirectShowReader is that we have
// a SourceFilter that wraps the MediaResource that connects to the
// MP3 decoder filter. The MP3 decoder filter "pulls" data as it requires it
// downstream on its own thread. When the MP3 decoder has produced a block of
// decoded samples, its thread calls downstream into our AudioSinkFilter,
// passing the decoded buffer in. The AudioSinkFilter inserts the samples into
// a SampleSink object. The SampleSink blocks the MP3 decoder's thread until
// the decode thread calls DecodeAudioData(), whereupon the SampleSink
// releases the decoded samples to the decode thread, and unblocks the MP3
// decoder's thread. The MP3 decoder can then request more data from the
// SourceFilter, and decode more data. If the decode thread calls
// DecodeAudioData() and there's no decoded samples waiting to be extracted
// in the SampleSink, the SampleSink blocks the decode thread until the MP3
// decoder produces a decoded sample.
