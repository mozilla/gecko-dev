 * of these methods are responsible for all synchronization. Beware!
 * These methods are called without the media graph monitor held, so
 * reentry into media graph methods is possible, although very much discouraged!
 * You should do something non-blocking and non-reentrant (e.g. dispatch an

 * stream.
