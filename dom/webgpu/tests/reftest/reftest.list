# The following condition is trying to capture "CI jobs that can't use
# webgpu". Using WebGPU in CI requires that it is enabled in the build, not
# disabled by preference, and that a GPU is present on the CI host.
#
# Since this condition applies to all tests in this file, and taskcluster will
# drop suites that have no enabled tests, it is important that this condition
# not erroneously skip these tests when evaluated under taskcluster's more
# limited view of the configuration.

# TODO: enable these tests after figuring out a proper skip condition
