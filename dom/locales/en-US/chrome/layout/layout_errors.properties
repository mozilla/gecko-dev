ImageMapRectBoundsError=The “coords” attribute of the <area shape="rect"> tag is not in the “left,top,right,bottom” format.
ImageMapCircleWrongNumberOfCoords=The “coords” attribute of the <area shape="circle"> tag is not in the “center-x,center-y,radius” format.
ImageMapCircleNegativeRadius=The “coords” attribute of the <area shape="circle"> tag has a negative radius.
ImageMapPolyWrongNumberOfCoords=The “coords” attribute of the <area shape="poly"> tag is not in the “x1,y1,x2,y2 …” format.
ImageMapPolyOddNumberOfCoords=The “coords” attribute of the <area shape="poly"> tag is missing the last “y” coordinate (the correct format is “x1,y1,x2,y2 …”).

TablePartRelPosWarning=Relative positioning of table rows and row groups is now supported. This site may need to be updated because it may depend on this feature having no effect.
ScrollLinkedEffectFound2=This site appears to use a scroll-linked positioning effect. This may not work well with asynchronous panning; see https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Performance/ScrollLinkedEffects for further details and to join the discussion on related tools and features!

## LOCALIZATION NOTE(CompositorAnimationWarningContentTooSmall):
## (%1$S, %2$S) is a pair of integer values of the frame size
CompositorAnimationWarningContentTooSmall=Animation cannot be run on the compositor because frame size (%1$S, %2$S) is smaller than (16, 16)
## LOCALIZATION NOTE(CompositorAnimationWarningContentTooLarge):
## (%1$S, %2$S) is a pair of integer values of the frame size
## (%3$S, %4$S) is a pair of integer values of the viewport size
## (%5$S, %6$S) is a pair of integer values of the visual rectangle size
## (%7$S) is an integer value
CompositorAnimationWarningContentTooLarge=Animation cannot be run on the compositor because the frame size (%1$S, %2$S) is bigger than the viewport (%3$S, %4$S) or the visual rectangle (%5$S, %6$S) is larger than the maximum allowed value (%7$S)
## LOCALIZATION NOTE(CompositorAnimationWarningTransformBackfaceVisibilityHidden):
## 'backface-visibility: hidden' is a CSS property, don't translate it.
CompositorAnimationWarningTransformBackfaceVisibilityHidden=Animations of ‘backface-visibility: hidden’ transforms cannot be run on the compositor
## LOCALIZATION NOTE(CompositorAnimationWarningTransformPreserve3D):
## 'transform-style: preserve-3d' is a CSS property, don't translate it.
CompositorAnimationWarningTransformPreserve3D=Animations of ‘transform-style: preserve-3d’ transforms cannot be run on the compositor
## LOCALIZATION NOTE(CompositorAnimationWarningTransformSVG,
##                   CompositorAnimationWarningTransformWithGeometricProperties,
##                   CompositorAnimationWarningTransformFrameInactive,
##                   CompositorAnimationWarningOpacityFrameInactive):
## 'transform' and 'opacity' mean CSS property names, don't translate it.
CompositorAnimationWarningTransformSVG=Animations of ‘transform’ on elements with SVG transforms cannot be run on the compositor
CompositorAnimationWarningTransformWithGeometricProperties=Animations of ‘transform’ cannot be run on the compositor when geometric properties are animated on the same element at the same time
CompositorAnimationWarningTransformFrameInactive=Animation cannot be run on the compositor because the frame was not marked active for ‘transform’ animation
CompositorAnimationWarningOpacityFrameInactive=Animation cannot be run on the compositor because the frame was not marked active for ‘opacity’ animation
CompositorAnimationWarningHasRenderingObserver=Animation cannot be run on the compositor because the element has rendering observers (-moz-element or SVG clipping/masking)
