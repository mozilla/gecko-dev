/*
 * The base class to implement a Task class.
 * The task is used to handle the OOP (out of process) operations.
 * The file system operations can only be performed in the parent process. When
 * performing such a parent-process-only operation, a task will delivered the
 * operation to the parent process if needed.
 *
 * The following diagram illustrates the how a API call from the content page
 * starts a task and gets call back results.
 *
 * The left block is the call sequence inside the child process, while the
 * right block is the call sequence inside the parent process.
 *
 * There are two types of API call. One is from the content page of the child
 * process and we mark the steps as (1) to (8). The other is from the content
 * page of the parent process and we mark the steps as (1') to (4').

 * 1. From child process page
 * Child:
 *   (1) Call FileSystem API from content page with JS. Create a task and run.
 *   The base constructor [FileSystemTaskBase()] of the task should be called.
 *   (2) Forward the task to the parent process through the IPC and call
 *   [GetRequestParams] to prepare the parameters of the IPC.
 * Parent:
 *   (3) The parent process receives IPC and handle it in
 *   FileystemRequestParent.
 *   Get the IPC parameters and create a task to run the IPC task. The base
 *   constructor [FileSystemTaskBase(aParam, aParent)] of the task should be
 *   called to set the task as an IPC task.
 *   (4) The task operation will be performed in the member function of [Work].
 *   A worker thread will be created to run that function. If error occurs
 *   during the operation, call [SetError] to record the error and then abort.
 *   (5) After finishing the task operation, call [HandleResult] to send the
 *   result back to the child process though the IPC.
 *   (6) Call [GetRequestResult] request result to prepare the parameters of the
 *   IPC. Because the formats of the error result for different task are the
 *   same, FileSystemTaskBase can handle the error message without interfering.
 *   Each task only needs to implement its specific success result preparation
 *   function -[GetSuccessRequestResult].
 * Child:
 *   (7) The child process receives IPC and calls [SetRequestResult] to get the
 *   task result. Each task needs to implement its specific success result
 *   parsing function [SetSuccessRequestResult] to get the success result.
 *   (8) Call [HandlerCallback] to send the task result to the content page.
 * 2. From parent process page
 * We don't need to send the task parameters and result to other process. So
 * there are less steps, but their functions are the same. The correspondence
 * between the two types of steps is:
 *   (1') = (1),
 *   (2') = (4),
 *   (3') = (5),
 *   (4') = (8).
