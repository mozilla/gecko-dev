dom.quota.try:
  error_step:
    type: event
    description: >
      An event recorded on an error of the quota manager or its clients.
      Since errors are usually propagated up the call chain, all such
      propagation steps are recorded for an error. This is only active
      during specific contexts, in particular during storage
      initialization. No dynamic data is included in the event beyond the
      error code which will be added through Bug 1670555.
      This event was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry event
      dom.quota.try.error#step.

quotamanager:
  restore_origin_directory_metadata_counter:
    type: counter
    description: >
      Increments each time QuotaManager::RestoreDirectoryMetadata2 is called to
      restore origin directory metadata. This typically occurs when expected
      directory metadata is missing or needs to be regenerated. The counter is
      incremented regardless of whether the restoration ultimately succeeds or
      fails.
      This can provide insight into the impacts of specific code changes,
      including potential optimizations or regressions.

quotamanager.initialize.repository:
  number_of_iterations:
    type: labeled_custom_distribution
    description: >
      This metric logs the count of directory entries iterated within the
      QuotaManager::InitializeRepository function for each repository type.
      Each instance of this metric is labeled with one of three repository
      types: "persistent", "temporary" or "default" (there's also "private"
      repository but that should never be iterated by the function).
      The main purpose is to track and analyze iteration counts during the
      initialization process of each repository type, helping to identify
      performance trends or potential inefficiencies across these repositories.
      This can provide insight into the impacts of specific code changes,
      including potential optimizations or regressions.

quotamanager.initialize.temporarystorage:
  total_time_excluding_suspend:
    type: timing_distribution
    time_unit: millisecond
    description: >
      This metric logs the total time required to initialize temporary storage
      within the QuotaManager after startup on the I/O thread. The duration
      excludes any periods when the system was suspended (e.g. system sleep or
      hibernation), to better reflect actual time spent performing temporary
      storage initialization.
      The primary goal is to measure the actual runtime cost of temporary
      storage initialization under typical conditions, without distortion from
      system-level suspension delays.
      This data can help detect performance regressions or improvements during
      startup-related phases, particularly for users with significant amounts
      of temporary storage data on disk.

quotamanager.shutdown:
  total_time_excluding_suspend:
    type: timing_distribution
    time_unit: millisecond
    description: >
      This metric logs the total time required to shut down the QuotaManager
      instance on the PBackground thread. The duration excludes any periods
      when the system was suspended (system sleep or hibernation), to better
      reflect actual time spent performing shutdown.
      While the shutdown process is measured on the PBackground thread, it
      involves spinning the event loop and thus waiting for operations on other
      threads (especially I/O threads) to complete.
      The primary goal is to measure the actual runtime cost of shutdown under
      typical conditions, without distortion from system-level suspension
      delays.
      This data can help detect performance regressions or improvements related
      to QuotaManager shutdown behavior, especially in scenarios involving
      large amounts of user storage data.
