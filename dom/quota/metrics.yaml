dom.quota.try:
  error_step:
    type: event
    description: >
      An event recorded on an error of the quota manager or its clients.
      Since errors are usually propagated up the call chain, all such
      propagation steps are recorded for an error. This is only active
      during specific contexts, in particular during storage
      initialization. No dynamic data is included in the event beyond the
      error code which will be added through Bug 1670555.
      This event was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry event
      dom.quota.try.error#step.

quotamanager.initialize.repository:
  number_of_iterations:
    type: labeled_custom_distribution
    description: >
      This metric logs the count of directory entries iterated within the
      QuotaManager::InitializeRepository function for each repository type.
      Each instance of this metric is labeled with one of three repository
      types: "persistent", "temporary" or "default" (there's also "private"
      repository but that should never be iterated by the function).
      The main purpose is to track and analyze iteration counts during the
      initialization process of each repository type, helping to identify
      performance trends or potential inefficiencies across these repositories.
      This can provide insight into the impacts of specific code changes,
      including potential optimizations or regressions.
