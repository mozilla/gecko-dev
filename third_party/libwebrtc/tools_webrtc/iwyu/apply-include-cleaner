# Run the include-cleaner tool (iwyu replacement) on a file in the webrtc source
# directory.
#
#
# In order to handle include paths correctly, you need to provide
# a compile DB (aka compile_commands.json).
# You can create it in one of the following ways:
# "gn gen --export-compile-commands path/to/out"
# "tools/clang/scripts/generate_compdb.py -p path/to/out > compile_commands.json"
# If "out/Default" exists, the script will attempt to generate it for you.
#
# clang-include-cleaner is built as part of the "clangd" package in our
# LLVM build.
# Example .gclient file:
# solutions = [
#  {
#    "name": "src",
#    "url": "https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src.git",
#    "deps_file": "DEPS",
#    "managed": False,
#    "custom_deps": {},
#    "custom_vars" : {
#      "checkout_clangd": True,
#      "download_remoteexec_cfg" : True,
#    }
#  },
# ]
