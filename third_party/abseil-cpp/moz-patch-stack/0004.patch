Subject: Bug 1795982 - pt3 - re-enable building absl/base:throw_delegate for
 missing ThrowStdOutOfRange. r=ng

More code in the new libwebrtc/third_party update uses throw_delegate, which
until now we've been able to carefully avoid.  However, in most cases, it
appears that ABSL_HAVE_EXCEPTIONS is turned off.  This is good because throwing
exceptions isn't enabled, but upstream aborts instead.  A static_assert was
added in throw_delegate.cc to verify that no exceptions can be thrown.
