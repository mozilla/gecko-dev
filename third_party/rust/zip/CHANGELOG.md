  initializing metadata from the local-file header or needing to mutably borrow the `ZipArchive`.
- `add_symlink_from_path`, `shallow_copy_file_from_path`, `deep_copy_file_from_path`, `raw_copy_file_to_path`: copy a
  file or create a symlink using `AsRef<Path>` arguments

### Changed

- `add_directory_from_path` and `start_file_from_path` are no longer deprecated, and they now normalize `..` as well as
  `.`.

## [1.0.1]

### Changed

- The published package on crates.io no longer includes the tests or examples.

## [1.0.0]

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed some rare bugs that could cause panics when trying to read an invalid ZIP file or using an incorrect password.

## [0.10.1]

### Changed

- Date and time conversion methods now return `DateTimeRangeError` rather than `()` on error.

## [0.10.0]

  shallow copy of a remaining file, or on an archive whose CDR entries are out
  of sequence. However, it may leave an unused entry in the archive.
- Calling `abort_file()` while writing a ZipCrypto-encrypted file no longer
  causes a crash.
- Calling `abort_file()` on the last file before `finish()` no longer produces
  an invalid ZIP file or garbage in the comment.

## [0.8.1]

### Fixed

- `ZipWriter` now once again implements `Send` if the underlying writer does.

## [0.8.0]

## [0.7.2]

### Added

## [0.7.0]

### Fixed

- Calling `start_file` with invalid parameters no longer closes the `ZipWriter`.

  1980-01-01 00:00:00.

### Added
