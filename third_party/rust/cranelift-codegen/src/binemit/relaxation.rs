//! Branch relaxation and offset computation.
//!
//! # EBB header offsets
//!
//! Before we can generate binary machine code for branch instructions, we need to know the final
//! offsets of all the EBB headers in the function. This information is encoded in the
//! `func.offsets` table.
//!
//! # Branch relaxation
//!
//! Branch relaxation is the process of ensuring that all branches in the function have enough
//! range to encode their destination. It is common to have multiple branch encodings in an ISA.
//! For example, x86 branches can have either an 8-bit or a 32-bit displacement.
//!
//! On RISC architectures, it can happen that conditional branches have a shorter range than
//! unconditional branches:
//!
//! ```clif
//!     brz v1, ebb17
//! ```
//!
//! can be transformed into:
//!
//! ```clif
//!     brnz v1, ebb23
//!     jump ebb17
//! ebb23:
//! ```

    //
    // 1. Set a flag on the new EBB that indicates it wants the preserve the register diversions of
    //    its layout predecessor, or
    // 2. Use an encoding macro for the branch-over-jump pattern so we don't need to split the EBB.
    //
    // It seems that 1. would allow us to share code among RISC ISAs that need this.
    //
    // We can't allow register diversions to survive from the layout predecessor because the layout
    // predecessor could contain kill points for some values that are live in this EBB, and
    // diversions are not automatically cancelled when the live range of a value ends.
