//! Benchmarking support
//!
//! Benchmarks are split up into two parts: the functions to be benchmarked live here, which the benchmarking code itself lives in `benches/bench.rs`.
//! It's easier to write benchmarking code inside the main crate, where we have access to private items.
//! However, it's easier to integrate with Cargo and criterion if benchmarks live in a separate crate.
//!
//! All benchmarks are defined as structs that implement either the [Benchmark] or [BenchmarkWithInput]
