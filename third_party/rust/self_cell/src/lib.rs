//! # Overview
//!
//! `self_cell` provides one macro-rules macro: [`self_cell`]. With this macro
//! you can create self-referential structs that are safe-to-use in stable Rust,
//! without leaking the struct internal lifetime.
//!
//! In a nutshell, the API looks *roughly* like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // User code:
//!
//! self_cell!(
//!     struct NewStructName {
//!         owner: Owner,
//!
//!         #[covariant]
//!         dependent: Dependent,
//!     }
//!
//!     impl {Debug}
//! );
//!
//! // Generated by macro:
//!
//! struct NewStructName(...);
//!
//! impl NewStructName {
//!     fn new(
//!         owner: Owner,
//!         dependent_builder: impl for<'a> ::core::ops::FnOnce(&'a Owner) -> Dependent<'a>
//!     ) -> NewStructName { ... }
//!     fn borrow_owner<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a Owner { ... }
//!     fn borrow_dependent<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a Dependent<'a> { ... }
//!     [...]
//!     // See the macro level documentation for a list of all generated functions,
//!     // and other possible options, e.g. async builder support, section "Generated API".
//!     
//! }
//!
//! impl Debug for NewStructName { ... }
//! ```
//!
//! Self-referential structs are currently not supported with safe vanilla Rust.
//! The only reasonable safe alternative is to have the user juggle 2 separate
//! data structures which is a mess. The library solution ouroboros is expensive
//! to compile due to its use of procedural macros.
//!
//! This alternative is `no_std`, uses no proc-macros, some self contained
//! unsafe and works on stable Rust, and is miri tested. With a total of less
//! than 300 lines of implementation code, which consists mostly of type and
//! trait implementations, this crate aims to be a good minimal solution to the
//! problem of self-referential structs.
//!
//! It has undergone [community code
//! review](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/experimental-safe-to-use-proc-macro-free-self-referential-structs-in-stable-rust/52775)
//! from experienced Rust users.
//!
//! ### Fast compile times
//!
//! ```txt
//! $ rm -rf target && cargo +nightly build -Z timings
//!
//! Compiling self_cell v0.7.0
//! Completed self_cell v0.7.0 in 0.2s
//! ```
//!
//! Because it does **not** use proc-macros, and has 0 dependencies
//! compile-times are fast.
//!
//! Measurements done on a slow laptop.
//!
//! ### A motivating use case
//!
//! ```rust
//! use self_cell::self_cell;
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
//! struct Ast<'a>(pub Vec<&'a str>);
//!
//! self_cell!(
//!     struct AstCell {
//!         owner: String,
//!
//!         #[covariant]
//!         dependent: Ast,
//!     }
//!
//!     impl {Debug, Eq, PartialEq}
//! );
//!
//! fn build_ast_cell(code: &str) -> AstCell {
//!     // Create owning String on stack.
//!     let pre_processed_code = code.trim().to_string();
//!
//!     // Move String into AstCell, then build Ast inplace.
//!     AstCell::new(
//!        pre_processed_code,
//!        |code| Ast(code.split(' ').filter(|word| word.len() > 1).collect())
//!     )
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let ast_cell = build_ast_cell("fox = cat + dog");
//!
//!     println!("ast_cell -> {:?}", &ast_cell);
//!     println!("ast_cell.borrow_owner() -> {:?}", ast_cell.borrow_owner());
//!     println!("ast_cell.borrow_dependent().0[1] -> {:?}", ast_cell.borrow_dependent().0[1]);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```txt
//! $ cargo run
//!
//! ast_cell -> AstCell { owner: "fox = cat + dog", dependent: Ast(["fox", "cat", "dog"]) }
//! ast_cell.borrow_owner() -> "fox = cat + dog"
//! ast_cell.borrow_dependent().0[1] -> "cat"
//! ```
//!
//! There is no way in safe Rust to have an API like `build_ast_cell`, as soon
//! as `Ast` depends on stack variables like `pre_processed_code` you can't
//! return the value out of the function anymore. You could move the
//! pre-processing into the caller but that gets ugly quickly because you can't
//! encapsulate things anymore. Note this is a somewhat niche use case,
//! self-referential structs should only be used when there is no good
//! alternative.
//!
//! Under the hood, it heap allocates a struct which it initializes first by
//! moving the owner value to it and then using the reference to this now
//! Pin/Immovable owner to construct the dependent inplace next to it. This
//! makes it safe to move the generated SelfCell but you have to pay for the
//! heap allocation.
//!
//! See the documentation for [`self_cell`] to dive further into the details.
//!
//! Or take a look at the advanced examples:
//! - [Example how to handle dependent construction that can fail](https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/tree/main/examples/fallible_dependent_construction)
//!
//! - [How to build a lazy AST with self_cell](https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/tree/main/examples/lazy_ast)
//!
//! - [How to handle dependents that take a mutable reference](https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/tree/main/examples/mut_ref_to_owner_in_builder) see also [`MutBorrow`]
//!
//! - [How to use an owner type with lifetime](https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/tree/main/examples/owner_with_lifetime)
//!
//! - [How to build the dependent with an async function](https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/tree/main/examples/async_builder)
//!
//! ### Min required rustc version
//!
//! By default the minimum required rustc version is 1.51.
//!
//! There is an optional feature you can enable called "old_rust" that enables
//! support down to rustc version 1.36. However this requires polyfilling std
//! library functionality for older rustc with technically UB versions. Testing
//! does not show older rustc versions (ab)using this. Use at your own risk.
//!
//! The minimum versions are a best effor and may change with any new major
//! release.

///         #[covariant]
///         dependent: Ast,
///     }
///
///     impl {Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash}
/// );
/// ```
///
/// See the crate overview to get a get an overview and a motivating example.
///
/// ### Generated API:
///
/// The macro implements these constructors:
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn new(
///     owner: $Owner,
///     dependent_builder: impl for<'a> ::core::ops::FnOnce(&'a $Owner) -> $Dependent<'a>
/// ) -> Self
/// ```
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn try_new<Err>(
///     owner: $Owner,
///     dependent_builder: impl for<'a> ::core::ops::FnOnce(&'a $Owner) -> Result<$Dependent<'a>, Err>
/// ) -> Result<Self, Err>
/// ```
///
/// ```ignore

///     owner: $Owner,
///     dependent_builder: impl for<'a> ::core::ops::FnOnce(&'a $Owner) -> Result<$Dependent<'a>, Err>

///
/// The macro implements these methods:
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn borrow_owner<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a $Owner
/// ```
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Only available if dependent is covariant.
/// fn borrow_dependent<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a $Dependent<'a>
/// ```
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn with_dependent<'outer_fn, Ret>(
///     &'outer_fn self,
///     func: impl for<'a> ::core::ops::FnOnce(&'a $Owner, &'outer_fn $Dependent<'a>
/// ) -> Ret) -> Ret

///     &'outer_fn mut self,
///     func: impl for<'a> ::core::ops::FnOnce(&'a $Owner, &'outer_fn mut $Dependent<'a>) -> Ret
/// ) -> Ret
/// ```
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn into_owner(self) -> $Owner
/// ```
///
///
/// ### Parameters:
///
/// - `$Vis:vis struct $StructName:ident` Name of the struct that will be
///   declared, this needs to be unique for the relevant scope. Example: `struct
///   AstCell` or `pub struct AstCell`. `$Vis` can be used to mark the struct
///   and all functions implemented by the macro as public.
///
///   `$(#[$StructMeta:meta])*` allows you specify further meta items for this
///   struct, eg. `#[doc(hidden)] struct AstCell`.
///
/// - `$Owner:ty` Type of owner. This has to have a `'static` lifetime. Example:
///   `String`.
///
/// - `$Dependent:ident` Name of the dependent type without specified lifetime.
///   This can't be a nested type name. As workaround either create a type alias
///   `type Dep<'a> = Option<Vec<&'a str>>;` or create a new-type `struct
///   Dep<'a>(Option<Vec<&'a str>>);`. Example: `Ast`.
///
///   `$Covariance:ident` Marker declaring if `$Dependent` is
///   [covariant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/subtyping.html).
///   Possible Values:
///
///   * **covariant**: This generates the direct reference accessor function
///     `borrow_dependent`. This is only safe to do if this compiles `fn
///     _assert_covariance<'x: 'y, 'y>(x: &'y $Dependent<'x>) -> &'y $Dependent<'y>
///     {x}`. Otherwise you could choose a lifetime that is too short for types
///     with interior mutability like `Cell`, which can lead to UB in safe code.
///     Which would violate the promise of this library that it is safe-to-use.
///     If you accidentally mark a type that is not covariant as covariant, you
///     will get a compile time error.
///
///   * **not_covariant**: This generates no additional code but you can use the
///     `with_dependent` function. See [How to build a lazy AST with
///     self_cell](https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/tree/main/examples/lazy_ast)
///     for a usage example.
///
///   In both cases you can use the `with_dependent_mut` function to mutate the
///   dependent value. This is safe to do because notionally you are replacing
///   pointers to a value not the other way around.
///
///   `#[$Covariance:ident, async_builder]` Optional marker that tells the macro to
///   generate `async` construction functions. `new`, `try_new` and `try_new_or_recover`
///   will all be `async` functions taking `async` closures as `dependent_builder`
///   functions.
///
/// - `impl {$($AutomaticDerive:ident),*},` Optional comma separated list of
///   optional automatic trait implementations. Possible Values:
///
///   * **Debug**: Prints the debug representation of owner and dependent.
///     Example: `AstCell { owner: "fox = cat + dog", dependent: Ast(["fox",
///     "cat", "dog"]) }`
///
///   * **PartialEq**: Logic `*self.borrow_owner() == *other.borrow_owner()`,
///     this assumes that `Dependent<'a>::From<&'a Owner>` is deterministic, so
///     that only comparing owner is enough.
///
///   * **Eq**: Will implement the trait marker `Eq` for `$StructName`. Beware
///     if you select this `Eq` will be implemented regardless if `$Owner`
///     implements `Eq`, that's an unfortunate technical limitation.
///
///   * **Hash**: Logic `self.borrow_owner().hash(state);`, this assumes that
///     `Dependent<'a>::From<&'a Owner>` is deterministic, so that only hashing
///     owner is enough.
///
///   All `AutomaticDerive` are optional and you can implement you own version
///   of these traits. The declared struct is part of your module and you are
///   free to implement any trait in any way you want. Access to the unsafe
///   internals is only possible via unsafe functions, so you can't accidentally
///   use them in safe code.
///
///   There is limited nested cell support. Eg, having an owner with non static
///   references. Eg `struct ChildCell<'a> { owner: &'a String, ...`. You can
///   use any lifetime name you want, except `_q` and only a single lifetime is
///   supported, and can only be used in the owner. Due to macro_rules
///   limitations, no `AutomaticDerive` are supported if an owner lifetime is
///   provided.
