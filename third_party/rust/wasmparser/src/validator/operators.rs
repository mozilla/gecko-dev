// The basic validation algorithm here is copied from the "Validation
// Algorithm" section of the WebAssembly specification -
// https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/appendix/algorithm.html.
//
// That algorithm is followed pretty closely here, namely `push_operand`,
// `pop_operand`, `push_ctrl`, and `pop_ctrl`. If anything here is a bit
// confusing it's recommended to read over that section to see how it maps to
// the various methods here.
