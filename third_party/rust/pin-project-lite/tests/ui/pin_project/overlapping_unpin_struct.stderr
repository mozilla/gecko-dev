error[E0277]: `PhantomPinned` cannot be unpinned
  --> tests/ui/pin_project/overlapping_unpin_struct.rs:21:16

21 |     is_unpin::<Foo<PhantomPinned>>(); //~ ERROR E0277
   |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ within `_::__Origin<'_, PhantomPinned>`, the trait `Unpin` is not implemented for `PhantomPinned`, which is required by `Foo<PhantomPinned>: Unpin`
   |
   = note: consider using the `pin!` macro
           consider using `Box::pin` if you need to access the pinned value outside of the current scope
note: required because it appears within the type `_::__Origin<'_, PhantomPinned>`

   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__pin_project_make_unpin_impl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `pin_project` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
