  description: >
    SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast,
    self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
  url: https://www.sqlite.org/
  release: version-3.47.2 (2024-12-07T20:39:59Z).
  revision: version-3.47.2
  license: Public Domain
  license-file: LICENSE.md
  notes: >
    We have Mozilla specific moz.build and sqlite.symbols in src/ to build the
    engine. SQLite extensions with similar build files are in ext/.
    Since this tracks the latest Github tag, if non-versioning tags are added
    then the update script will fail, and you may have to pass a specific
    --revision with the appropriate github tag to mach vendor.
