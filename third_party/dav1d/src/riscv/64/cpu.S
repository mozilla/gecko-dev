// This function detects non-compliant RVV 0.7.1 hardware which reports support
//  for the V extension through HWCAP, by intentionally setting tail and mask
//  agnostic vector configurations that were only introduced in RVV 0.9 spec.
// Existing non-compliant (pre RVV 1.0) hardware will set the VILL bit in VTYPE
//  (indicating an illegal vector configuration) which is stored in the XLEN-1
//  bit position, thus a simple sign check is sufficient for detection.
// This work around is inexpensive and harmless on compliant hardware, but we
//  should still consider removing it once all non-compliant RVV 0.7.1 hardware
//  is out of service.
