# These definitions provide a single source of truth for modules attempting
# to get a view of all tests for a build. Used by the emitter to figure out
# how to read/install manifests and by test dependency annotations in Files()
# entries to enumerate test flavors.

# While there are multiple test manifests, the behavior is very similar
# across them. We enforce this by having common handling of all
# manifests and outputting a single class type with the differences
# described inside the instance.
#
# Keys are variable prefixes and values are tuples describing how these
# manifests should be handled:
#
#    (flavor, install_root, install_subdir, package_tests)
#
# flavor identifies the flavor of this test.
# install_root is the path prefix to install the files starting from the root
#     directory and not as specified by the manifest location. (bug 972168)
# install_subdir is the path of where to install the files in
#     the tests directory.
# package_tests indicates whether to package test files into the test
#     package; suites that compile the test files should not install
#     them into the test package.
