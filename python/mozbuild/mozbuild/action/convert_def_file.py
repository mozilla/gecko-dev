# NSS .def files serve multiple masters, as this copied comment indicates:
#
# OK, this file is meant to support SUN, LINUX, AIX and WINDOWS
#   1. For all unix platforms, the string ";-"  means "remove this line"
#   2. For all unix platforms, the string " DATA " will be removed from any 
#	line on which it occurs.
#   3. Lines containing ";+" will have ";+" removed on SUN and LINUX.
#      On AIX, lines containing ";+" will be removed.  
#   4. For all unix platforms, the string ";;" will have the ";;" removed.
#   5. For all unix platforms, after the above processing has taken place,
#    all characters after the first ";" on the line will be removed.  
#    And for AIX, the first ";" will also be removed.
#  This file is passed directly to windows. Since ';' is a comment, all UNIX
#   directives are hidden behind ";", ";+", and ";-"
#
# We don't care about rule 1, as that mainly serves to eliminate LIBRARY
# and EXPORTS lines.  We don't want to enforce rule 3, as we know how to
# eliminate comments. ';+' also tends to hide Unix linker-script specific
# things, which we don't want to deal with here.  Rule 5 is also unnecessary;
# later comment-aware processing will deal with that.
#
# We do need to handle rule 2, since our symbol extraction doesn't want to
# see DATA keywords.  We also need to handle rule 4, since ';;' often hides
# things marked with DATA.
