:mod:`macholib.mach_o` --- Low-level definitions
================================================

.. module:: macholib.mach_o
   :synopsis: Low-level definitions of elements in a Mach-O file

This module defines constants and packable structure types
that correspond to elements of a Mach-O file.

The names of classes and constants is the same as those in
the Mach-O header files and 
`Apple's documentation <http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html>`_. This document therefore
doesn't explictly document the names in this module.
