- The recommended way to run tests (also on Windows) is to cd into parent
  directory and run:

    make test

- If you're on Python < 2.7 unittest2 module must be installed first:
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2

- The main test script is test_psutil.py, which also imports platform-specific
  _*.py scripts (which should be ignored).

- test_memory_leaks.py looks for memory leaks into C extension modules and must
  be run separately with:

    make memtest
