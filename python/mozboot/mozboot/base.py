It's possible your package manager doesn't support a modern version of

PYTHON_UPGRADE_FAILED = '''
We attempted to upgrade Python to a modern version (%s or newer).
However, you appear to still have version %s.

It's possible your package manager doesn't yet expose a modern version of
Python. It's also possible Python is not being installed in the search path for
this shell. Try creating a new shell and run this bootstrapper again.

If this continues to fail and you are sure you have a modern Python on your
system, ensure it is on the $PATH and try again. If that fails, you'll need to
install Python manually and ensure the path with the python binary is listed in
the $PATH environment variable.

We recommend the following tools for installing Python:

    pyenv   -- https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)
    pythonz -- https://github.com/saghul/pythonz
    official installers -- http://www.python.org/
