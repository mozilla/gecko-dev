<p>Mozilla is a free software community best known for producing the Firefox web browser. The Mozilla community uses, develops, spreads and supports Mozilla products and works to advance the goals of the Open Web described in the Mozilla Manifesto.[1] The community is supported institutionally by the Mozilla Foundation and its tax-paying subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.[2] </p>

<p>On February 23, 1998, Netscape Communications Corporation created a project called Mozilla (after the original code name of the Netscape Navigator browser which — according to Pascal Finette — is a mashup of "Mosaic Killer") to co-ordinate the development of the Mozilla Application Suite, the open source version of Netscape's internet software, Netscape Communicator.[3][4] Jamie Zawinski says he came up with the name "Mozilla" at a Netscape staff meeting.[5][6] A small group of Netscape employees were tasked with coordination of the new community.<p>

<p>Originally, Mozilla aimed to be a technology provider for companies, such as Netscape, who would commercialize their open source code.[7] When AOL (Netscape's parent company) drastically scaled back its involvement with Mozilla in July 2003, the Mozilla Foundation was launched as the legal steward of the project.[8] Soon after, Mozilla deprecated the Mozilla Suite in favor of creating independent applications for each function, primarily the Firefox web browser and the Thunderbird email client, and moved to supply them direct to the public.[9]<p>
