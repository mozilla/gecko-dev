Ms Palsdottir had a similar power of attorney.</p><p>Court records show that Wintris had significant investments in the bonds of three major Icelandic banks that collapsed during the financial crisis which began in 2008. Wintris is listed as a creditor with millions of dollars in claims in the banks' bankruptcies. </p><p>Mr Gunnlaugsson became prime minister in 2013 and has been involved in negotiations about the banks which could affect the value of the bonds held by Wintris.</p><p>He resisted pressure from foreign creditors - including many UK customers - to repay their deposits in full. Had foreign investors been repaid, it might have adversely affected both the Icelandic banks and the value of the bonds held by Wintris.</p><p>But Mr Gunnlaugsson kept his wife's interest in the outcome a secret.</p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">'Lost all trust'</h2><p>On Monday, Icelandic opposition parties called on Mr Gunnlaugsson to resign over the alleged conflict of interest and said they planned to table a confidence motion in parliament.</p><p>\"What would be the most natural and the right thing to do is that [he] resign as prime minister,\" Birgitta Jonsdottir, the head of the Pirate Party, told the Reuters news agency. \"There is a great and strong demand for that in society and he has totally lost all his trust and believability.\"</p><figure class=\"media-landscape no-caption full-width\">\n            <span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                 <span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n                 <span class=\"story-image-copyright\">Iceland Monitor/Eva Bj√∂rk</span>\n                \n            </span>\n            \n        </figure><p>Former Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir, who oversaw Iceland's recovery from the financial crisis, meanwhile wrote on Facebook: \"The prime minister should immediately resign.\"</p><p>An online petition demanding Mr Gunnlaugsson's resignation also had some 24,000 signatures - more than 7% of the island nation's population.</p><p>But in an interview with Channel 2 television, the prime minister insisted he had put the interests of the Icelandic people ahead of the interests of the failed banks' claimants.</p><p>\"I have not considered quitting because of this matter nor am I going to quit because of this matter,\" he said.</p><p>\"The government has had good results.
