/**
 * Implements a Least-Recently-Used cache for Favicons, keyed by Favicon URL.
 *
 * When a favicon at a particular URL is decoded, it will yield one or more bitmaps.
 * While in memory, these bitmaps are stored in a list, sorted in ascending order of size, in a
 * FaviconsForURL object.
 * The collection of FaviconsForURL objects currently in the cache is stored in mBackingMap, keyed
 * by favicon URL.
 *
 * A second map exists for permanent cache entries -- ones that are never expired. These entries
 * are assumed to be disjoint from those in the normal cache, and this map is checked first.
 *
 * FaviconsForURL provides a method for obtaining the smallest icon larger than a given size - the
 * most appropriate icon for a particular size.
 * It also distinguishes between "primary" favicons (Ones that have merely been extracted from a
 * file downloaded from the website) and "secondary" favicons (Ones that have been computed locally
 * as resized versions of primary favicons.).
 *
 * FaviconsForURL is also responsible for storing URL-specific, as opposed to favicon-specific,
 * information. For the purposes of this cache, the simplifying assumption that the dominant colour
 * for all favicons served from a particular favicon URL shall be the same is made. (To violate this
 * would mandate serving an ICO or similar file with multiple radically different images in it - an
 * ill-advised and extremely uncommon use-case, for sure.)
 * The dominant colour information is updated as the element is being added to the cache - typically
 * on the background thread.
 * Also present here are the download timestamp and isFailed flag. Upon failure, the flag is set.
 * A constant exists in this file to specify the maximum time permitted between failures before
 * a retry is again permitted.
 *
 * TODO: Expiry of Favicons from the favicon database cache is not implemented. (Bug 914296)
 *
 * A typical request to the cache will consist of a Favicon URL and a target size. The FaviconsForURL
 * object for that URL will be obtained, queried for a favicon matching exactly the needed size, and
 * if successful, the result is returned.
 * If unsuccessful, the object is asked to return the smallest available primary favicon larger than
 * the target size. If this step works, the result is downscaled to create a new secondary favicon,
 * which is then stored (So subsequent requests will succeed at the first step) and returned.
 * If that step fails, the object finally walks backwards through its sequence of favicons until it
 * finds the largest primary favicon smaller than the target. This is then upscaled by a maximum of
 * 2x towards the target size, and the result cached and returned as above.
 *
 * The bitmaps themselves are encapsulated inside FaviconCacheElement objects. These objects contain,
 * as well as the bitmap, a pointer to the encapsulating FaviconsForURL object (Used by the LRU
 * culler), the size of the encapsulated image, a flag indicating if this is a primary favicon, and
 * a flag indicating if the entry is invalid.
 * All FaviconCacheElement objects are tracked in the mOrdering LinkedList. This is used to record
 * LRU information about FaviconCacheElements. In particular, the most recently used FaviconCacheElement
 * will be at the start of the list, the least recently used at the end of the list.
 *
 * When the cache runs out of space, it removes FaviconCacheElements starting from the end of the list
 * until a sufficient amount of space has been freed.
 * When a secondary favicon is removed in this way, it is simply deleted from its parent FaviconsForURLs
 * object's list of available favicons.
 * The backpointer field on the FaviconCacheElement is used to remove the element from the encapsulating
 * FaviconsForURL object, when this is required.
 * When a primary favicon is removed, its invalid flag is set to true and its bitmap payload is set
 * to null (So it is available for freeing by the garbage collector). This reduces the memory footprint
 * of the icon to essentially zero, but keeps track of which primary favicons exist for this favicon
 * URL.
 * If a subsequent request comes in for that favicon URL, it is then known that a primary of those
 * dimensions is available, just that it is not in the cache. The system is then able to load the
 * primary back into the cache from the database (Where the entirety of the initially encapsulating
 * container-formatted image file is stored).
 * If this were not done, then when processing requests after the culling of primary favicons it would
 * be impossible to distinguish between the nonexistence of a primary and the nonexistence of a primary
 * in the cache without querying the database.
 *
 * The implementation is safe to use from multiple threads and, while is it not entirely strongly
 * consistent all of the time, you almost certainly don't care.
 * The thread-safety implementation used is approximately MRSW with semaphores. An extra semaphore
 * is used to grant mutual exclusion over reordering operations from reader threads (Who thus gain
 * a quasi-writer status to do such limited mutation as is necessary).
 *
 * Reads which race with writes are liable to not see the ongoing write. The cache may return a
 * stale or now-removed value to the caller. Returned values are never invalid, even in the face
 * of concurrent reading and culling.
