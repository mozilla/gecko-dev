/**
 * This annotation is used to tag methods that are to have wrapper methods generated in the android
 * bridge. Such methods will be protected from destruction by Proguard, and allow us to avoid writing
 * by hand large amounts of boring boilerplate.
 * An annotated Java method will have a corresponding method generated in the android bridge.
 * By default, the name of the generated method will be the same as the name of the Java method, with
 * the first letter in upper case. The stubName property may be used to specify a custom name for the
 * generated method stub.
 *
 * allowMultithreaded should be used as sparingly as possible - the resulting code will allow the
 * Java method to be invoked from the C side from multiple threads. Often, this isn't what is wanted
 * and may lead to subtle bugs.
