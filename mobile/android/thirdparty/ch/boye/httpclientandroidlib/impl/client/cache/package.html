This package contains a cache module that can be used for HTTP/1.1
client-side caching. The primary classes in this package are the
{@link org.apache.http.impl.client.cache.CachingHttpClient},
which is a drop-in replacement for
a {@link org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient} that adds
caching, and the {@link org.apache.http.impl.client.cache.CacheConfig}
class that can be used for configuring it.
