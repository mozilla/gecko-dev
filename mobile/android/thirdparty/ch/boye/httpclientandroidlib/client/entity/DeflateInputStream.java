            * stream. RFC2616 calls zlib streams deflate. Confusing, isn't it? That's why some servers

            * We could start looking at the bytes, but to be honest, someone else has already read
            * the RFCs and implemented that for us. So we'll just use the JDK libraries and exception
            * handling to do this. If that proves slow, then we could potentially change this to check
            * the first byte - does it look like a CMF? What about the second byte - does it look like
