 * to store a processing state for one message or several consecutive messages.
 * Multiple logically related messages can participate in a logical session

 * IMPORTANT: Please note HTTP context implementation, even when thread safe,
 * may not be used concurrently by multiple threads, as the context may contain
 * thread unsafe attributes.
