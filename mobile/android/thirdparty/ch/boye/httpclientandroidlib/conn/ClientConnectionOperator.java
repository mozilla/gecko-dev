 * likely make use of {@link ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.conn.scheme.SchemeSocketFactory}s
 * to create {@link java.net.Socket} instances.
 * <p>
 * The methods in this interface allow the creation of plain and layered
 * sockets. Creating a tunnelled connection through a proxy, however,
 * is not within the scope of the operator.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be thread-safe. Access to shared
 * data must be synchronized as methods of this interface may be executed
 * from multiple threads.
