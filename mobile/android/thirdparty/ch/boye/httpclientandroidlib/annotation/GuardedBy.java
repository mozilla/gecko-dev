/**
 * The field or method to which this annotation is applied can only be accessed
 * when holding a particular lock, which may be a built-in (synchronization) lock,
 * or may be an explicit java.util.concurrent.Lock.
 *
 * The argument determines which lock guards the annotated field or method:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <code>this</code> : The intrinsic lock of the object in whose class the field is defined.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <code>class-name.this</code> : For inner classes, it may be necessary to disambiguate 'this';
 * the <em>class-name.this</em> designation allows you to specify which 'this' reference is intended
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <code>itself</code> : For reference fields only; the object to which the field refers.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <code>field-name</code> : The lock object is referenced by the (instance or static) field
 * specified by <em>field-name</em>.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <code>class-name.field-name</code> : The lock object is reference by the static field specified
 * by <em>class-name.field-name</em>.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <code>method-name()</code> : The lock object is returned by calling the named nil-ary method.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <code>class-name.class</code> : The Class object for the specified class should be used as the lock object.
 * </li>
 * <p>
 * Based on code developed by Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls and concepts
 * published in 'Java Concurrency in Practice' by Brian Goetz, Tim Peierls,
 * Joshua Bloch, Joseph Bowbeer, David Holmes and Doug Lea.
