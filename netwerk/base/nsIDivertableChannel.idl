   * CHILD ONLY.
   * Called by Necko client in child process during OnStartRequest to divert
   * nsIStreamListener and nsIRequest callbacks to the parent process.
   *
   * The process should look like the following:
   *
   * 1) divertToParent is called in the child process.  It can only be called
   *    during OnStartRequest().
   *
   * 2) The ChannelDiverterChild that is returned is an IPDL object. It should
   *    be passed via some other IPDL method of the client's choosing to the
   *    parent.  On the parent the ChannelDiverterParent's divertTo() function
   *    should be called with an nsIStreamListener that will then receive the
   *    OnStartRequest/OnDataAvailable/OnStopRequest for the channel.  The
   *    ChannelDiverterParent can then be deleted (which will also destroy the
   *    ChannelDiverterChild in the child).
   *
   *    After divertToParent() has been called, NO further function calls
   *    should be made on the channel.  It is a dead object for all purposes.
   *    The reference that the channel holds to the listener in the child is
   *    released is once OnStartRequest completes, and no other
   *    nsIStreamListener calls (OnDataAvailable, OnStopRequest) will be made
   *    to it.
   *
   * @return ChannelDiverterChild IPDL actor to be passed to parent process by
   *         client IPDL message, e.g. PClient.DivertUsing(PDiverterChild).
   *
   * @throws exception if the channel was canceled early. Throws status code of
   *         canceled channel.
