This is the CodeMirror editor packaged for the Mozilla Project. CodeMirror
is a JavaScript component that provides a code editor in the browser. When
a mode is available for the language you are coding in, it will color your
code, and optionally help with indentation.

# Upgrade

Currently used version is 3.20. To upgrade, download a new version of
CodeMirror from the project's page [1] and replace all JavaScript and
CSS files inside the codemirror directory [2].

To confirm the functionality run mochitests for the following components:

 * sourceeditor
 * scratchpad
 * debugger
 * styleditor
 * netmonitor

The sourceeditor component contains imported CodeMirror tests [3].

 * Some tests were commented out because we don't use that functionality
   within Firefox (for example Ruby editing mode). Be careful when updating
   files test/codemirror.html and test/vimemacs.html; they were modified to
   co-exist with Mozilla's testing infrastructure.
 * In cm_comment_test.js comment out fallbackToBlock and fallbackToLine
   tests.
 * The search addon (search.js) was slightly modified to make search
   UI localizable.

Other than that, we don't have any Mozilla-specific patches applied to
CodeMirror itself.

# Addons
