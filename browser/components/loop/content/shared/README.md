Loop Shared Web Assets
======================

This directory contains web assets shared across the Loop client webapp and the
Loop Firefox Component.

Warning
-------

Any modification in these files will have possible side effects on both the
Firefox component and the webapp. The `css/readme.html` file uses all the shared
styles, you should use it as a way of checking for visual regressions.
