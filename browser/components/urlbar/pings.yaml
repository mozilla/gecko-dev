urlbar-keyword-exposure:
  description: |
    This ping is submitted only when urlbar keyword exposures are enabled. See
    the `recordKeywordExposures` urlbar Nimbus variable. When enabled, the ping
    is submitted at the end of urlbar sessions during which one or more exposure
    results are matched. (A "session" begins when the user focuses the urlbar
    and ends with an engagement or abandonment.) Exposure results include all
    results defined in the `exposureResults` variable. They also include the
    "rust_exposure" result type if the `quickSuggestExposureSuggestionTypes`
    variable is defined. The ping will contain one `urlbar.keyword_exposure`
    event for each instance where a result is matched during the session. The
    ping is not submitted for sessions in private windows.
