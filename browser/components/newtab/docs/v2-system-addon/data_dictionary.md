# Activity Stream Pings

The Activity Stream system add-on sends various types of pings to the backend (HTTPS POST) [Onyx server](https://github.com/mozilla/onyx) :
- a `health` ping that reports whether or not a user has a custom about:home or about:newtab page
- a `session` ping that describes the ending of an Activity Stream session (a new tab is closed or refreshed), and
- an `event` ping that records specific data about individual user interactions while interacting with Activity Stream
- a `performance` ping that records specific performance related events
- an `undesired` ping that records data about bad app states and missing data
- an `impression_stats` ping that records data about Pocket impressions and user interactions

Schema definitions/validations that can be used for tests can be found in `system-addon/test/schemas/pings.js`.

Note: the following session-related fields are not yet implemented in the system-addon,
but will likely be added in future versions:

```js
{
  "total_bookmarks": 19,
  "total_history_size": 9,
  "highlights_size": 20
}
```

This encoding mapping was defined in `system-addon/lib/TelemetryFeed.jsm`
