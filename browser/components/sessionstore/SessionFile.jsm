/**
 * Implementation of all the disk I/O required by the session store.
 * This is a private API, meant to be used only by the session store.
 * It will change. Do not use it for any other purpose.
 *
 * Note that this module implicitly depends on one of two things:
 * 1. either the asynchronous file I/O system enqueues its requests
 *   and never attempts to simultaneously execute two I/O requests on
 *   the files used by this module from two distinct threads; or
 * 2. the clients of this API are well-behaved and do not place
 *   concurrent requests to the files used by this module.
 *
 * Otherwise, we could encounter bugs, especially under Windows,
 *   e.g. if a request attempts to write sessionstore.js while
 *   another attempts to copy that file.
 *
 * This implementation uses OS.File, which guarantees property 1.
