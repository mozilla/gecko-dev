          If is_temporarily_shown is true and should_hide is false, this means
          that the button stayed visible after the user tried to hide it.

          If is_temporarily_shown is true and should_hide is true, this means
          that the button was temporarily visible when the user made it
          permanently visible again.

      When the user prefers the Extensions Button to be hidden, the default
      "Extensions and Themes" item in the Application Menu is replaced with an
      "Extensions" item, which serves as an alternative trigger for the
      Extensions Button.

      This event records when the user clicks on this "Extensions" menu item.

          Whether the Extensions Panel is unable to show any extensions.

          When false, the Extensions Panel is opened.

          When true, about:addons is opened, at least until an empty state is
          added (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1814871). When
          that bug is resolved, the Extensions Panel is always opened.

      is_extensions_button_visible:
        description: |
          Whether the Extensions Button is visible. Although the appmenu item
          is only shown when the user prefers the button to be hidden, it is
          possible for the button to be shown despite the user's preference if
          there was a reason to show the button temporarily.

          If true, this could be a sign that the user is confused about the
          function of the appmenu item, because the Extensions Button offers
          exactly the same functionality, except in a more visible location
          (on the toolbar).
        type: boolean

  temporarily_unhidden:
    type: labeled_counter
    description: >
      Counts how often the hidden Extensions Button is temporarily shown.
      There are multiple possible triggers for showing the extensions button,
      only the first that would trigger the transition from hidden to shown is
      going to be counted. For example, if the button is shown because the
      "attention" dot is shown, and a permission prompt is shown, then we only
      count the trigger for the attention dot, not the permission prompt.

      customize is when the user entered Customize Mode, which causes the
      Extensions Button to show unconditionally until the user exits the mode.

      addon_install_doorhanger covers notifications related to add-on
      installations, including blocked installations, add-on download progress,
      and failed installations. Permission prompts are NOT part of this, but
      covered by extension_permission_prompt. A typical installation flow
      triggers both addon_install_doorhanger and extension_permission_prompt.

      extension_controlled_setting is when a notification is anchored to the
      Extensions Button that notifies the user of an extension-triggered change
      (new tab page, home page, first use of tabs.hide()). This is shown on
      first use of the relevant feature after the installation of an extension.

      browser_action_open_popup is when the browserAction popup is opened. This
      is usually user-triggered (shortcut, context menu) or via the
      `action.openPopup()` API.

      extension_permission_prompt is when an extension permission prompt is
      shown. This does not distinguish between install-time permission prompts,
      permission prompts on update or optional permission prompts at runtime.

      extensions_panel_showing is when the Extensions Panel is being shown,
      for example via the Extensions appmenu item.

      attention_blocklist is when the browser wants to draw attention to the
      fact that one of the add-ons has been blocklisted.

      attention_permission_denied is when the browser wants to draw attention
      to the fact that one of the extensions was denied access to the page in
      the currently displayed tab. The access request is not a strong signal:
      a MV3 extension with content scripts whose permissions have been revoked
      by the user could trigger such an attention request on all websites.
