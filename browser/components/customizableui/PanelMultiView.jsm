/**
 * Allows a popup panel to host multiple subviews. The main view shown when the
 * panel is opened may slide out to display a subview, which in turn may lead to
 * other subviews in a cascade menu pattern.
 *
 * The <panel> element should contain a <panelmultiview> element. Views are
 * declared using <panelview> elements that are usually children of the main
 * <panelmultiview> element, although they don't need to be, as views can also
 * be imported into the panel from other panels or popup sets.
 *
 * The panel should be opened asynchronously using the openPopup static method
 * on the PanelMultiView object. This will display the view specified using the
 * mainViewId attribute on the contained <panelmultiview> element.
 *
 * Specific subviews can slide in using the showSubView method, and backwards
 * navigation can be done using the goBack method or through a button in the
 * subview headers.
 *
 * The process of displaying the main view or a new subview requires multiple
 * steps to be completed, hence at any given time the <panelview> element may
 * be in different states:
 *
 * -- Open or closed
 *
 *    All the <panelview> elements start "closed", meaning that they are not
 *    associated to a <panelmultiview> element and can be located anywhere in
 *    the document. When the openPopup or showSubView methods are called, the
 *    relevant view becomes "open" and the <panelview> element may be moved to
 *    ensure it is a descendant of the <panelmultiview> element.
 *
 *    The "ViewShowing" event is fired at this point, when the view is not
 *    visible yet. The event is allowed to cancel the operation, in which case
 *    the view is closed immediately.
 *
 *    Closing the view does not move the node back to its original position.
 *
 * -- Visible or invisible
 *
 *    This indicates whether the view is visible in the document from a layout
 *    perspective, regardless of whether it is currently scrolled into view. In
 *    fact, all subviews are already visible before they start sliding in.
 *
 *    Before scrolling into view, a view may become visible but be placed in a
 *    special off-screen area of the document where layout and measurements can
 *    take place asyncronously.
 *
 *    When navigating forward, an open view may become invisible but stay open
 *    after sliding out of view. The last known size of these views is still
 *    taken into account for determining the overall panel size.
 *
 *    When navigating backwards, an open subview will first become invisible and
 *    then will be closed.
 *
 * -- Active or inactive
 *
 *    This indicates whether the view is fully scrolled into the visible area
 *    and ready to receive mouse and keyboard events. An active view is always
 *    visible, but a visible view may be inactive. For example, during a scroll
 *    transition, both views will be inactive.
 *
 *    When a view becomes active, the ViewShown event is fired synchronously,
 *    and the showSubView and goBack methods can be called for navigation.
 *
 *    For the main view of the panel, the ViewShown event is dispatched during
 *    the "popupshown" event, which means that other "popupshown" handlers may
 *    be called before the view is active. Thus, code that needs to perform
 *    further navigation automatically should either use the ViewShown event or
 *    wait for an event loop tick, like BrowserTestUtils.waitForEvent does.
 *
 * -- Navigating with the keyboard
 *
 *    An open view may keep state related to keyboard navigation, even if it is
 *    invisible. When a view is closed, keyboard navigation state is cleared.
 *
 * This diagram shows how <panelview> nodes move during navigation:
