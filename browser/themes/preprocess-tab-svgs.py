# By default, the pre-processor used for jar.mn will use "%" as a marker
# for ".css" files and "#" otherwise. This falls apart when a file using
# one marker needs to include a file with the other marker since the
# pre-processor instructions in the included file will not be
# processed. The following SVG files need to include a file which uses
# "%" as the marker so we invoke the pre- processor ourselves here with
# the marker specified. The resulting SVG files will get packaged by the
# processing of the jar file in the appropriate directory.
