sync:
  description: |
    This is an aggregated format that contains information about each sync that
    occurred during a timeframe.
    It is submitted every 12 hours, and on browser shutdown,
    but only if the syncs property would not be empty.

    Each item in the `syncs` property is generated after a sync is completed,
    for both successful and failed syncs,
    and contains measurements pertaining to sync performance and error
    information.
  reasons:
    shutdown: |
      Ping submitted due to app shutdown.
    schedule: |
      12h have elapsed since the previous ping.
    idchanged: |

      Probably means a different user has logged in.
