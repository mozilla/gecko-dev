/**
 * Represents a collection of related pieces/fields of data.
 *
 * This is an abstract base type.
 *
 * This type provides the primary interface for storing, retrieving, and
 * serializing data.
 *
 * Each measurement consists of a set of named fields. Each field is primarily
 * identified by a string name, which must be unique within the measurement.
 *
 * Each derived type must define the following properties:
 *
 *   name -- String name of this measurement. This is the primary way
 *     measurements are distinguished within a provider.
 *
 *   version -- Integer version of this measurement. This is a secondary
 *     identifier for a measurement within a provider. The version denotes
 *     the behavior of this measurement and the composition of its fields over
 *     time. When a new field is added or the behavior of an existing field
 *     changes, the version should be incremented. The initial version of a
 *     measurement is typically 1.
 *
 *   fields -- Object defining the fields this measurement holds. Keys in the
 *     object are string field names. Values are objects describing how the
 *     field works. The following properties are recognized:
 *
 *       type -- The string type of this field. This is typically one of the
 *         FIELD_* constants from the Metrics.Storage type.
 *
 *
 * FUTURE: provide hook points for measurements to supplement with custom
 * storage needs.

/**
 * An entity that emits data.
 *
 * A `Provider` consists of a string name (must be globally unique among all
 * known providers) and a set of `Measurement` instances.
 *
 * The main role of a `Provider` is to produce metrics data and to store said
 * data in the storage backend.
 *
 * Metrics data collection is initiated either by a manager calling a
 * `collect*` function on `Provider` instances or by the `Provider` registering
 * to some external event and then reacting whenever they occur.
 *
 * `Provider` implementations interface directly with a storage backend. For
 * common stored values (daily counters, daily discrete values, etc),
 * implementations should interface with storage via the various helper
 * functions on the `Measurement` instances. For custom stored value types,
 * implementations will interact directly with the low-level storage APIs.
 *
 * Because multiple providers exist and could be responding to separate
 * external events simultaneously and because not all operations performed by
 * storage can safely be performed in parallel, writing directly to storage at
 * event time is dangerous. Therefore, interactions with storage must be
 * deferred until it is safe to perform them.
 *
 * This typically looks something like:
 *
 *   // This gets called when an external event worthy of recording metrics
 *   // occurs. The function receives a numeric value associated with the event.
 *   function onExternalEvent (value) {
 *     let now = new Date();
 *     let m = this.getMeasurement("foo", 1);
 *
 *     this.enqueueStorageOperation(function storeExternalEvent() {
 *
 *       // We interface with storage via the `Measurement` helper functions.
 *       // These each return a promise that will be resolved when the
 *       // operation finishes. We rely on behavior of storage where operations
 *       // are executed single threaded and sequentially. Therefore, we only
 *       // need to return the final promise.
 *       m.incrementDailyCounter("foo", now);
 *       return m.addDailyDiscreteNumericValue("my_value", value, now);
 *     }.bind(this));
 *
 *   }
 *
 *
 * `Provider` is an abstract base class. Implementations must define a few
 * properties:
 *
 *   name
 *     The `name` property should be a string defining the provider's name. The
 *     name must be globally unique for the application. The name is used as an
 *     identifier to distinguish providers from each other.
 *
 *   measurementTypes
 *     This must be an array of `Measurement`-derived types. Note that elements
 *     in the array are the type functions, not instances. Instances of the
 *     `Measurement` are created at run-time by the `Provider` and are bound
 *     to the provider and to a specific storage backend.
