=======================
Firefox Services Module
=======================

The ``/services`` directory contains code for a variety of application
features that communicate with external services - hence its name.

It was originally created to hold code for Firefox Sync. Later, it
became the location for code written by the Mozilla Services Client team
and thus includes :ref:`healthreport`. This team no longer exists, but
the directory remains.
