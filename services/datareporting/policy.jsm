 * Represents a request to display data policy.
 *
 * Instances of this are created when the policy is requesting the user's
 * approval to agree to the data submission policy.
 *
 * Receivers of these instances are expected to call one or more of the on*
 * functions when events occur.
 *
 * When one of these requests is received, the first thing a callee should do
 * is present notification to the user of the data policy. When the notice
 * is displayed to the user, the callee should call `onUserNotifyComplete`.
 * This begins a countdown timer that upon completion will signal implicit
 * acceptance of the policy. If for whatever reason the callee could not
 * display a notice, it should call `onUserNotifyFailed`.
 *
 * Once the user is notified of the policy, the callee has the option of
 * signaling explicit user acceptance or rejection of the policy. They do this
 * by calling `onUserAccept` or `onUserReject`, respectively. These functions
 * are essentially proxies to
 * DataReportingPolicy.{recordUserAcceptance,recordUserRejection}.
 *
 * If the user never explicitly accepts or rejects the policy, it will be
 * implicitly accepted after a specified duration of time. The notice is
 * expected to remain displayed even after implicit acceptance (in case the
 * user is away from the device). So, no event signaling implicit acceptance
 * is exposed.
 *
 * Receivers of instances of this type should treat it as a black box with
 * the exception of the on* functions.
 *
 * @param policy
 *        (DataReportingPolicy) The policy instance this request came from.

/**
 * Manages scheduling of Firefox Health Report data submission.
 *
 * The rules of data submission are as follows:
 *
 *  1. Do not submit data more than once every 24 hours.
 *  2. Try to submit as close to 24 hours apart as possible.
 *  3. Do not submit too soon after application startup so as to not negatively
 *     impact performance at startup.
 *  4. Before first ever data submission, the user should be notified about
 *     data collection practices.
 *  5. User should have opportunity to react to this notification before
 *     data submission.
 *  6. Display of notification without any explicit user action constitutes
 *     implicit consent after a certain duration of time.
 *  7. If data submission fails, try at most 2 additional times before giving
 *     up on that day's submission.
 *
 * The listener passed into the instance must have the following properties
 * (which are callbacks that will be invoked at certain key events):
 *
 *   * onRequestDataUpload(request) - Called when the policy is requesting
 *     data to be submitted. The function is passed a `DataSubmissionRequest`.
 *     The listener should call one of the special resolving functions on that
 *     instance (see the documentation for that type).
 *
 *   * onRequestRemoteDelete(request) - Called when the policy is requesting
 *     deletion of remotely stored data. The function is passed a
 *     `DataSubmissionRequest`. The listener should call one of the special
 *     resolving functions on that instance (just like `onRequestDataUpload`).
 *
 *   * onNotifyDataPolicy(request) - Called when the policy is requesting the
 *     user to be notified that data submission will occur. The function
 *     receives a `NotifyPolicyRequest` instance. The callee should call one or
 *     more of the functions on that instance when specific events occur. See
 *     the documentation for that type for more.
 *
 * Note that the notification method is abstracted. Different applications
 * can have different mechanisms by which they notify the user of data
 * submission practices.
 *
 * @param policyPrefs
 *        (Preferences) Handle on preferences branch on which state will be
 *        queried and stored.
 * @param healthReportPrefs
 *        (Preferences) Handle on preferences branch holding Health Report state.
 * @param listener
 *        (object) Object with callbacks that will be invoked at certain key
 *        events.
