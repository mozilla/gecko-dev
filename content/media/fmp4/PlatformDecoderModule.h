// access to the H264 and AAC decoders provided by various platforms. It
// may be extended to support other codecs in future. Each platform (Windows,
// MacOSX, Linux, B2G etc) must implement a PlatformDecoderModule to provide
// access to its decoders in order to get decompressed H.264/AAC from the
// MP4Reader.
//
// Video decoding is asynchronous, and should be performed on the task queue
// provided if the underlying platform isn't already exposing an async API.
