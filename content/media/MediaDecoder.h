Each video element based on MediaDecoder has a state machine to manage
its play state and keep the current frame up to date. All state machines
share time in a single shared thread. Each decoder also has a MediaTaskQueue
running in a SharedThreadPool to decode audio and video data.
Each decoder also has a thread to push decoded audio
to the hardware. This thread is not created until playback starts, but
currently is not destroyed when paused, only when playback ends.

The decoder owns the resources for downloading the media file, and the
high level state. It holds an owning reference to the state machine that
owns all the resources related to decoding data, and manages the low level
decoding operations and A/V sync.

Each state machine runs on the shared state machine thread. Every time some
action is required for a state machine, it is scheduled to run on the shared
the state machine thread. The state machine runs one "cycle" on the state
machine thread, and then returns. If necessary, it will schedule itself to
run again in future. While running this cycle, it must not block the
thread, as other state machines' events may need to run. State shared
between a state machine's threads is synchronised via the monitor owned
by its MediaDecoder object.

The Main thread controls the decode state machine by setting the value
of a mPlayState variable and notifying on the monitor based on the
high level player actions required (Seek, Pause, Play, etc).

The player states are the states requested by the client through the
DOM API.  They represent the desired state of the player, while the
decoder's state represents the actual state of the decoder.

The high level state of the player is maintained via a PlayState value.
It can have the following states:

START
  The decoder has been initialized but has no resource loaded.
PAUSED
  A request via the API has been received to pause playback.
LOADING
  A request via the API has been received to load a resource.
PLAYING
  A request via the API has been received to start playback.
SEEKING
  A request via the API has been received to start seeking.
COMPLETED
  Playback has completed.
SHUTDOWN
  The decoder is about to be destroyed.

State transition occurs when the Media Element calls the Play, Seek,
etc methods on the MediaDecoder object. When the transition
occurs MediaDecoder then calls the methods on the decoder state
machine object to cause it to behave as required by the play state.
State transitions will likely schedule the state machine to run to
affect the change.

An implementation of the MediaDecoderStateMachine class is the event
that gets dispatched to the state machine thread. Each time the event is run,
the state machine must cycle the state machine once, and then return.

The state machine has the following states:

DECODING_METADATA
  The media headers are being loaded, and things like framerate, etc are
  being determined, and the first frame of audio/video data is being decoded.
DECODING
  The decode has started. If the PlayState is PLAYING, the decode thread
  should be alive and decoding video and audio frame, the audio thread
  should be playing audio, and the state machine should run periodically
  to update the video frames being displayed.
SEEKING
  A seek operation is in progress. The decode thread should be seeking.
BUFFERING
  Decoding is paused while data is buffered for smooth playback. If playback
  is paused (PlayState transitions to PAUSED) we'll destory the decode thread.
COMPLETED
  The resource has completed decoding, but possibly not finished playback.
  The decode thread will be destroyed. Once playback finished, the audio
  thread will also be destroyed.
SHUTDOWN
  The decoder object and its state machine are about to be destroyed.
  Once the last state machine has been destroyed, the shared state machine
  thread will also be destroyed. It will be recreated later if needed.

The following result in state transitions.

Shutdown()
  Clean up any resources the MediaDecoderStateMachine owns.
Play()
  Start decoding and playback of media data.
Buffer
  This is not user initiated. It occurs when the
  available data in the stream drops below a certain point.
Complete
  This is not user initiated. It occurs when the
  stream is completely decoded.
Seek(double)
  Seek to the time position given in the resource.

The following represents the states that the MediaDecoder object
can be in, and the valid states the MediaDecoderStateMachine can be in at that
time:

player LOADING   decoder DECODING_METADATA
player PLAYING   decoder DECODING, BUFFERING, SEEKING, COMPLETED
player PAUSED    decoder DECODING, BUFFERING, SEEKING, COMPLETED
player SEEKING   decoder SEEKING
player COMPLETED decoder SHUTDOWN
player SHUTDOWN  decoder SHUTDOWN

The general sequence of events is:

1) The video element calls Load on MediaDecoder. This creates the
   state machine and starts the channel for downloading the
   file. It instantiates and schedules the MediaDecoderStateMachine. The
   high level LOADING state is entered, which results in the decode
   thread being created and starting to decode metadata. These are
   the headers that give the video size, framerate, etc. Load() returns
   immediately to the calling video element.

2) When the metadata has been loaded by the decode thread, the state machine
   will call a method on the video element object to inform it that this
   step is done, so it can do the things required by the video specification
   at this stage. The decode thread then continues to decode the first frame
   of data.

3) When the first frame of data has been successfully decoded the state
   machine calls a method on the video element object to inform it that
   this step has been done, once again so it can do the required things
   by the video specification at this stage.

   This results in the high level state changing to PLAYING or PAUSED
   depending on any user action that may have occurred.

   While the play state is PLAYING, the decode thread will decode
   data, and the audio thread will push audio data to the hardware to
   be played. The state machine will run periodically on the shared
   state machine thread to ensure video frames are played at the
   correct time; i.e. the state machine manages A/V sync.

The Shutdown method on MediaDecoder closes the download channel, and
signals to the state machine that it should shutdown. The state machine
shuts down asynchronously, and will release the owning reference to the
state machine once its threads are shutdown.

The owning object of a MediaDecoder object *MUST* call Shutdown when
destroying the MediaDecoder object.
