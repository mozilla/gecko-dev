Each media element for a media file has one thread called the "audio thread".

The audio thread  writes the decoded audio data to the audio
hardware. This is done in a separate thread to ensure that the
audio hardware gets a constant stream of data without
interruption due to decoding or display. At some point
AudioStream will be refactored to have a callback interface
where it asks for data and this thread will no longer be
needed.

The element/state machine also has a MediaTaskQueue which runs in a
SharedThreadPool that is shared with all other elements/decoders. The state
machine dispatches tasks to this to call into the MediaDecoderReader to
request decoded audio or video data. The Reader will callback with decoded
sampled when it has them available, and the state machine places the decoded
samples into its queues for the consuming threads to pull from.

The MediaDecoderReader can choose to decode asynchronously, or synchronously
and return requested samples synchronously inside it's Request*Data()
functions via callback. Asynchronous decoding is preferred, and should be
used for any new readers.

Synchronisation of state between the thread is done via a monitor owned
by MediaDecoder.

The lifetime of the audio thread is controlled by the state machine when
it runs on the shared state machine thread. When playback needs to occur
the audio thread is created and an event dispatched to run it. The audio
thread exits when audio playback is completed or no longer required.

A/V synchronisation is handled by the state machine. It examines the audio
playback time and compares this to the next frame in the queue of video
frames. If it is time to play the video frame it is then displayed, otherwise
it schedules the state machine to run again at the time of the next frame.

Frame skipping is done in the following ways:

  1) The state machine will skip all frames in the video queue whose
     display time is less than the current audio time. This ensures
     the correct frame for the current time is always displayed.

  2) The decode tasks will stop decoding interframes and read to the
     next keyframe if it determines that decoding the remaining
     interframes will cause playback issues. It detects this by:
       a) If the amount of audio data in the audio queue drops
          below a threshold whereby audio may start to skip.
       b) If the video queue drops below a threshold where it
          will be decoding video data that won't be displayed due
          to the decode thread dropping the frame immediately.
     TODO: In future we should only do this when the Reader is decoding
           synchronously.

When hardware accelerated graphics is not available, YCbCr conversion
is done on the decode task queue when video frames are decoded.

The decode task queue pushes decoded audio and videos frames into two
separate queues - one for audio and one for video. These are kept
separate to make it easy to constantly feed audio data to the audio
hardware while allowing frame skipping of video data. These queues are
threadsafe, and neither the decode, audio, or state machine should
be able to monopolize them, and cause starvation of the other threads.

Both queues are bounded by a maximum size. When this size is reached
the decode tasks will no longer request video or audio depending on the
queue that has reached the threshold. If both queues are full, no more
decode tasks will be dispatched to the decode task queue, so other
decoders will have an opportunity to run.

During playback the audio thread will be idle (via a Wait() on the
monitor) if the audio queue is empty. Otherwise it constantly pops
audio data off the queue and plays it with a blocking write to the audio
hardware (via AudioStream).
