/*
Each video element for a media file has two threads:

  1) The Audio thread writes the decoded audio data to the audio
     hardware. This is done in a separate thread to ensure that the
     audio hardware gets a constant stream of data without
     interruption due to decoding or display. At some point
     AudioStream will be refactored to have a callback interface
     where it asks for data and an extra thread will no longer be
     needed.

  2) The decode thread. This thread reads from the media stream and
     decodes the Theora and Vorbis data. It places the decoded data into
     queues for the other threads to pull from.

All file reads, seeks, and all decoding must occur on the decode thread.
Synchronisation of state between the thread is done via a monitor owned
by MediaDecoder.

The lifetime of the decode and audio threads is controlled by the state
machine when it runs on the shared state machine thread. When playback
needs to occur they are created and events dispatched to them to run
them. These events exit when decoding/audio playback is completed or
no longer required.

A/V synchronisation is handled by the state machine. It examines the audio
playback time and compares this to the next frame in the queue of video
frames. If it is time to play the video frame it is then displayed, otherwise
it schedules the state machine to run again at the time of the next frame.

Frame skipping is done in the following ways:

  1) The state machine will skip all frames in the video queue whose
     display time is less than the current audio time. This ensures
     the correct frame for the current time is always displayed.

  2) The decode thread will stop decoding interframes and read to the
     next keyframe if it determines that decoding the remaining
     interframes will cause playback issues. It detects this by:
       a) If the amount of audio data in the audio queue drops
          below a threshold whereby audio may start to skip.
       b) If the video queue drops below a threshold where it
          will be decoding video data that won't be displayed due
          to the decode thread dropping the frame immediately.

When hardware accelerated graphics is not available, YCbCr conversion
is done on the decode thread when video frames are decoded.

The decode thread pushes decoded audio and videos frames into two
separate queues - one for audio and one for video. These are kept
separate to make it easy to constantly feed audio data to the audio
hardware while allowing frame skipping of video data. These queues are
threadsafe, and neither the decode, audio, or state machine should
be able to monopolize them, and cause starvation of the other threads.

Both queues are bounded by a maximum size. When this size is reached
the decode thread will no longer decode video or audio depending on the
queue that has reached the threshold. If both queues are full, the decode
thread will wait on the decoder monitor.

When the decode queues are full (they've reaced their maximum size) and
the decoder is not in PLAYING play state, the state machine may opt
to shut down the decode thread in order to conserve resources.

During playback the audio thread will be idle (via a Wait() on the
monitor) if the audio queue is empty. Otherwise it constantly pops
audio data off the queue and plays it with a blocking write to the audio
hardware (via AudioStream).
