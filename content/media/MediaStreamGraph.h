/*
 * MediaStreamGraph is a framework for synchronized audio/video processing
 * and playback. It is designed to be used by other browser components such as
 * HTML media elements, media capture APIs, real-time media streaming APIs,
 * multitrack media APIs, and advanced audio APIs.
 *
 * The MediaStreamGraph uses a dedicated thread to process media --- the media
 * graph thread. This ensures that we can process media through the graph
 * without blocking on main-thread activity. The media graph is only modified
 * on the media graph thread, to ensure graph changes can be processed without
 * interfering with media processing. All interaction with the media graph
 * thread is done with message passing.
 *
 * APIs that modify the graph or its properties are described as "control APIs".
 * These APIs are asynchronous; they queue graph changes internally and
 * those changes are processed all-at-once by the MediaStreamGraph. The
 * MediaStreamGraph monitors the main thread event loop via nsIAppShell::RunInStableState
 * to ensure that graph changes from a single event loop task are always
 * processed all together. Control APIs should only be used on the main thread,
 * currently; we may be able to relax that later.
 *
 * To allow precise synchronization of times in the control API, the
 * MediaStreamGraph maintains a "media timeline". Control APIs that take or
 * return times use that timeline. Those times never advance during
 * an event loop task. This time is returned by MediaStreamGraph::GetCurrentTime().
 *
 * Media decoding, audio processing and media playback use thread-safe APIs to
 * the media graph to ensure they can continue while the main thread is blocked.
 *
 * When the graph is changed, we may need to throw out buffered data and
 * reprocess it. This is triggered automatically by the MediaStreamGraph.

/**
 * A stream of synchronized audio and video data. All (not blocked) streams
 * progress at the same rate --- "real time". Streams cannot seek. The only
 * operation readers can perform on a stream is to read the next data.
 *
 * Consumers of a stream can be reading from it at different offsets, but that
 * should only happen due to the order in which consumers are being run.
 * Those offsets must not diverge in the long term, otherwise we would require
 * unbounded buffering.
 *
 * Streams can be in a "blocked" state. While blocked, a stream does not
 * produce data. A stream can be explicitly blocked via the control API,
 * or implicitly blocked by whatever's generating it (e.g. an underrun in the
 * source resource), or implicitly blocked because something consuming it
 * blocks, or implicitly because it has finished.
 *
 * A stream can be in a "finished" state. "Finished" streams are permanently
 * blocked.
 *
 * Transitions into and out of the "blocked" and "finished" states are managed
 * by the MediaStreamGraph on the media graph thread.
 *
 * We buffer media data ahead of the consumers' reading offsets. It is possible
 * to have buffered data but still be blocked.
 *
 * Any stream can have its audio and video playing when requested. The media
 * stream graph plays audio by constructing audio output streams as necessary.
 * Video is played by setting video frames into an VideoFrameContainer at the right
 * time. To ensure video plays in sync with audio, make sure that the same
 * stream is playing both the audio and video.
 *
 * The data in a stream is managed by StreamBuffer. It consists of a set of
 * tracks of various types that can start and end over time.
 *
 * Streams are explicitly managed. The client creates them via
 * MediaStreamGraph::CreateInput/ProcessedMediaStream, and releases them by calling
 * Destroy() when no longer needed (actual destruction will be deferred).
 * The actual object is owned by the MediaStreamGraph. The basic idea is that
 * main thread objects will keep Streams alive as long as necessary (using the
 * cycle collector to clean up whenever needed).
 *
 * We make them refcounted only so that stream-related messages with MediaStream*
 * pointers can be sent to the main thread safely.
 *
 * The lifetimes of MediaStreams are controlled from the main thread.
 * For MediaStreams exposed to the DOM, the lifetime is controlled by the DOM
 * wrapper; the DOM wrappers own their associated MediaStreams. When a DOM
 * wrapper is destroyed, it sends a Destroy message for the associated
 * MediaStream and clears its reference (the last main-thread reference to
 * the object). When the Destroy message is processed on the graph
 * manager thread we immediately release the affected objects (disentangling them
 * from other objects as necessary).
 *
 * This could cause problems for media processing if a MediaStream is
 * destroyed while a downstream MediaStream is still using it. Therefore
 * the DOM wrappers must keep upstream MediaStreams alive as long as they
 * could be being used in the media graph.
 *
 * At any time, however, a set of MediaStream wrappers could be
 * collected via cycle collection. Destroy messages will be sent
 * for those objects in arbitrary order and the MediaStreamGraph has to be able
 * to handle this.
