**Hello,** and thanks for your interest in contributing to Firefox DevTools! 

DevTools is a complex web app, but if you're familiar with either HTML/CSS or JavaScript, you can create a patch!

The initial setup process of building Firefox can take a while. If you get stuck at any point, you can ask for help on the [DevTools Slack](https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/). 

We all make lots of errors when we get started, so don't worry about thatâ€”there are safeguards in place to ensure that any commits that land in the Firefox repository are peer-reviewed, can be built, and pass the tests in multiple configurations and operating systems.

(Note: You can navigate these docs with the arrow keys.)
