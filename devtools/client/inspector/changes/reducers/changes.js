   * CSS changes are collected on the server by the ChangesActor which dispatches them to

   *
   * By design, the ChangesActor has no big-picture context of all the collected changes.
   * It only holds the stack of atomic changes. This makes it roboust for many use cases:
   * building a diff-view, supporting undo/redo, offline persistence, etc. Consumers,
   * like the Changes panel, get to massage the data for their particular purposes.
   *
   * Here in the reducer, we aggregate incoming changes to build a human-readable diff
   * shown in the Changes panel.
   * - added / removed declarations are grouped by CSS rule. Rules are grouped by their
   *   parent rules (@media, @supports, @keyframes, etc.); Rules belong to sources
   *   (stylesheets, inline styles)
   * - declarations have an index corresponding to their position in the CSS rule. This
   *   allows tracking of multiple declarations with the same property name.
   * - repeated changes a declaration will show only the original removal and the latest
   *   addition;
   * - when a declaration is removed, we update the indices of other tracked declarations
   *   in the same rule which may have changed position in the rule as a result;
   * - changes which cancel each other out (i.e. return to original) are both removed
   *   from the store;
   * - when changes cancel each other out leaving the rule unchanged, the rule is removed
   *   from the store. Its parent rule is removed as well if it too ends up unchanged.
