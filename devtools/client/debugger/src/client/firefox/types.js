/**
 * The protocol is carried by a reliable, bi-directional byte stream; data sent
 * in both directions consists of JSON objects, called packets. A packet is a
 * top-level JSON object, not contained inside any other value.
 *
 * Every packet sent to the client has the form:
 *  `{ "to":actor, "type":type, ... }`
 *
 * where actor is the name of the actor to whom the packet is directed and type
 * is a string specifying what sort of packet it is. Additional properties may
 * be present, depending on type.
 *
 * Every packet sent from the server has the form:
 *  `{ "from":actor, ... }`
 *
 * where actor is the name of the actor that sent it. The packet may have
 * additional properties, depending on the situation.
 *
 * If a packet is directed to an actor that no longer exists, the server
 * sends a packet to the client of the following form:
 *  `{ "from":actor, "error":"noSuchActor" }`
 *
 * where actor is the name of the non-existent actor. (It is strange to receive
 * messages from actors that do not exist, but the client evidently believes
 * that actor exists, and this reply allows the client to pair up the error
 * report with the source of the problem.)
 *
 * Clients should silently ignore packet properties they do not recognize. We
 * expect that, as the protocol evolves, we will specify new properties that
 * can appear in existing packets, and experimental implementations will do
 * the same.
