"react-redux" uses UMD style loading to work in many different environments.
It assumes that "react" and "redux" are both included via `require("react")`
as in node or browserify, but the paths to our react and redux installation are different.

If upgrading react-redux, define the correct paths and replace the require statements
for the module.exports case with the correct paths.

Path to react: "devtools/client/shared/vendor/react"
Path to redux: "devtools/client/shared/vendor/redux"
