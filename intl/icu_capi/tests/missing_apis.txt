# This file contains all APIs that are exposed in Rust but not over FFI, and not allowlisted in IGNORED_PATHS in tools/ffi_coverage/allowlist.rs.
# It is generated by `cargo make diplomat-coverage`.
#
# If adding an API that expands this file, please consider:
#
#  - Whether you can expose that API over FFI in the same PR (and if you do so, be sure to add a `rust_link` annotation)
#  - Whether the API already has its functionality exposed over FFI (if so, add a potentially-`hidden` `rust_link` annotation to the corresponding FFI API)
#  - Whether that API is rust-specific functionality that need not be exposed (if so, add it to the allowlist with a note, or add a `hidden` `rust_link` annotation to a related API if possible)
#  - Whether that API should be punted for later in FFI (if so, please check in with @Manishearth, @robertbastian, or @sffc)
#  - Whether the API is experimental (if so, add it to the allowlist as experimental)
#
# It is acceptable to temporarily have APIs in this file that you plan to add in a soon-upcoming PR.
#
# Please check in with @Manishearth, @robertbastian, or @sffc if you have questions
