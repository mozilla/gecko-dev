 int hnj_hyphen_hyphenate2(): non-standard hyphenation.

 (It supports Catalan, Dutch, German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Swedish
  etc. orthography, see documentation.)
 
 input data:
 word:      input word
 word_size: byte length of the input word
 
 hyphens:   allocated character buffer (size = word_size + 5)
 hyphenated_word: allocated character buffer (size ~ word_size * 2) or NULL
 rep, pos, cut: pointers (point to the allocated and _zeroed_ buffers
                (size=word_size) or with NULL value) or NULL

 output data:
 hyphens:   hyphenation vector (hyphenation points signed with odd numbers)
 hyphenated_word: hyphenated input word (hyphens signed with `='),
                  optional (NULL input)
 rep:       NULL (only standard hyph.), or replacements (hyphenation points
            signed with `=' in replacements);
 pos:       NULL, or difference of the actual position and the beginning
            positions of the change in input words;
 cut:       NULL, or counts of the removed characters of the original words
            at hyphenation,

 Note: rep, pos, cut are complementary arrays to the hyphens, indexed with the
       character positions of the input word.

 For example:
 Schiffahrt -> Schiff=fahrt,
 pattern: f1f/ff=f,1,2
 output: rep[5]="ff=f", pos[5] = 1, cut[5] = 2

 Note: hnj_hyphen_hyphenate2() can allocate rep, pos, cut (word_size
       length arrays):

 char ** rep = NULL;
 int * pos = NULL;
 int * cut = NULL;
 char hyphens[MAXWORDLEN];
 hnj_hyphen_hyphenate2(dict, "example", 7, hyphens, NULL, &rep, &pos, &cut);
 
 See example in the source distribution.
