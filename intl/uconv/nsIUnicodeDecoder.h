  /**
   * Converts the data from one Charset to Unicode.
   *
   * About the byte ordering:
   * - For input, if the converter cares (that depends of the charset, for 
   * example a singlebyte will ignore the byte ordering) it should assume 
   * network order. If necessary and requested, we can add a method 
   * SetInputByteOrder() so that the reverse order can be used, too. That 
   * method would have as default the assumed network order.
   * - The output stream is Unicode, having the byte order which is internal
   * for the machine on which the converter is running on.
   *
   * Unless there is not enough output space, this method must consume all the
   * available input data! The eventual incomplete final character data will be
   * stored internally in the converter and used when the method is called 
   * again for continuing the conversion. This way, the caller will not have to
   * worry about managing incomplete input data by mergeing it with the next 
   * buffer.
   *
   * Error conditions: 
   * If the read value does not belong to this character set, one should 
   * replace it with the Unicode special 0xFFFD. When an actual input error is 
   * encountered, like a format error, the converter stop and return error.
   * However, we should keep in mind that we need to be lax in decoding. When
   * a decoding error is returned to the caller, it is the caller's
   * responsibility to advance over the bad byte (unless aSrcLength is -1 in
   * which case the caller should call the decoder with 0 offset again) and
   * reset the decoder before trying to call the decoder again.
   *
   * Converter required behavior:
   * In this order: when output space is full - return right away. When input
   * data is wrong, return input pointer right after the wrong byte. When 
   * partial input, it will be consumed and cached. All the time input pointer
   * will show how much was actually consumed and how much was actually 
   * written.
   *
   * @param aSrc        [IN] the source data buffer
   * @param aSrcLength  [IN/OUT] the length of source data buffer; after
   *                    conversion will contain the number of bytes read or
   *                    -1 on error to indicate that the caller should re-push
   *                    the same buffer after resetting the decoder

   *                    was encountered and the behavior was set to "signal";
   *                    the caller must skip over one byte, reset the decoder
   *                    and retry.
   *                    NS_OK_UDEC_MOREOUTPUT if only a partial conversion
   *                    was done; more output space is needed to continue

   *                    of an input code unit sequence. If this is the last
   *                    result the caller has at the end of the stream, the
   *                    caller must append one U+FFFD to the output.
   *                    NS_OK if the input ended after a complete input code
   *                    unit sequence.
