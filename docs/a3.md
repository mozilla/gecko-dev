### Bug Diagnosis
There is a redundant `continue` statement at the end of a while loop in file `mozilla-central/dom/media/MediaCache.cpp` on line number `2561`. The `continue` statement does not serve any purpose as it is at the very end of the loop so it must be removed as part of this issue. Fixing this bug will get rid of the redundancy and make the code more consice and easy to follow.

### Solution 
To fix this issue we just need to remove line `2561` from `mozilla-central/dom/media/MediaCache.cpp`.

### Testing Procedure 
Go to file `mozilla-central/dom/media/MediaCache.cpp` and verify that the `continue` statement at the end of loop starting on line `2526` is removed.
