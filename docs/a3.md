## Diagnosis		
There was a typo in `browser/base/content/aboutNetError.js`.		
Issue with Symantec certificate is generally harmless and was not intended to display intimidating yellow border when the warning message was being shown to the user. 		
However, due to a typo, it was not checking the condition properly and displayed yellow border.	
Though most of websites had already resolved their issue with Symantec certificate, this bug had to be resolved as it is part of security feature of FireFox and have to be consistant in terms of when yellow border should  appear. By fixing this bug, it will promote consistancy and reduce confusion for future developer

## Solution 
This bug is caused by a simple typo, solution is to fix `erroCodeString` to `errorCodeString`		
in `browser/base/content/aboutNetError.js`
