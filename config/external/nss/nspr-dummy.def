; This is a fake .def file, to be used for generating linker scripts
; for our folded libnss when MOZ_FOLD_LIBS.  NSPR, unlike NSS, exports
; symbols with symbol visibility (Unix) or __declspec (Windows).  When
; using a linker script, however, we need to explicitly specify that
; NSPR's symbols should be globally visible.  Otherwise, NSPR's exported
; symbols would match the |local: *| rule and be hidden.
