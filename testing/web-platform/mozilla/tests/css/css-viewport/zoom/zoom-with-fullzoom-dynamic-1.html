<!-- This test verifies that css 'zoom' properly stacks with full-page zoom, in
     subdocuments, particularly when the full-page-zoom is dynamically adjusted
     after pageload. This test has a 3x css-zoom that gets applied to the
     iframe, which combines with a 5x css-zoom on the root node inside the
     iframe; and then after flushing paints, this test adds an additional 2x
     full-page-zoom factor. This test's expectation is that these zoom factors
     all stack to forma  2*3*5=30x effective zoom inside the iframe. -->
