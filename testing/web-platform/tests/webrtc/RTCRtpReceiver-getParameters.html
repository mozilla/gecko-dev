  // Test is based on the following editor draft:
  // https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/archives/20170605/webrtc.html

  // The following helper functions are called from RTCRtpParameters-helper.js:
  //   validateReceiverRtpParameters

  /*
    Validates the RTCRtpParameters returned from RTCRtpReceiver.prototype.getParameters

    5.3.  RTCRtpReceiver Interface
      getParameters
        When getParameters is called, the RTCRtpParameters dictionary is constructed
        as follows:

        - The headerExtensions sequence is populated based on the header extensions that
          the receiver is currently prepared to receive.

        - The codecs sequence is populated based on the codecs that the receiver is currently
          prepared to receive.

        - rtcp.reducedSize is set to true if the receiver is currently prepared to receive
          reduced-size RTCP packets, and false otherwise. rtcp.cname is left undefined.

        - transactionId and degradationPreference are left undefined.
