See the [GitHub support page](https://help.github.com/articles/about-email-notifications/)
for how to filter certain types of email notifications. However, the most
useful `Cc` email address is not listed on that page:
`review_requested@noreply.github.com` is for when you are added as a reviewer
on a pull request.
