Firefox Puppeteer
=================

Firefox Puppeteer is a library built on top of the `Marionette python client`_.
It aims to make automation of Firefox's browser UI simpler. It does **not**
make sense to use Firefox Puppeteer if:

* You are manipulating something other than Firefox (like Firefox OS)
* You are only manipulating elements in content scope (like a webpage)

Roughly speaking, Firefox Puppeteer provides a library to manipulate each
visual section of Firefox's browser UI. For example, there are different
libraries for the tab bar, the navigation bar, etc.


Installation
------------

Currently Firefox Puppeteer lives in the `firefox-ui-tests`_ repository,
along with instructions for installation and usage.
There are plans to move it alongside the `Marionette python client`_.

The following libraries are currently implemented. More will be added in the
future. Each library is available from an instance of the FirefoxTestCase class.
