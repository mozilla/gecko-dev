 * Instances of this class represent moments in time, or a special
 * "null" moment. We do not use the non-monotonic system clock or
 * local time, since they can be reset, causing apparent backward
 * travel in time, which can confuse algorithms. Instead we measure
 * elapsed time according to the system.  This time can never go
 * backwards (i.e. it never wraps around, at least not in less than
 * five million years of system elapsed time). It might not advance
 * while the system is sleeping. If TimeStamp::SetNow() is not called
 * at all for hours or days, we might not notice the passage of some
 * of that time.
 * 
 * We deliberately do not expose a way to convert TimeStamps to some
 * particular unit. All you can do is compute a difference between two
 * TimeStamps to get a TimeDuration. You can also add a TimeDuration
 * to a TimeStamp to get a new TimeStamp. You can't do something
 * meaningless like add two TimeStamps.
 *
 * Internally this is implemented as either a wrapper around
 *   - high-resolution, monotonic, system clocks if they exist on this
 *     platform
 *   - PRIntervalTime otherwise.  We detect wraparounds of
 *     PRIntervalTime and work around them.
 *
 * This class is similar to C++11's time_point, however it is
 * explicitly nullable and provides an IsNull() method. time_point
 * is initialized to the clock's epoch and provides a
 * time_since_epoch() method that functions similiarly. i.e.
 * t.IsNull() is equivalent to t.time_since_epoch() == decltype(t)::duration::zero();
