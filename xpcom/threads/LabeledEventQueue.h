// associated SchedulerGroup). When an event is added to a LabeledEventQueue, we
// query its SchedulerGroup and then add it to the appropriate queue. When an
// event is fetched, we heuristically pick a SchedulerGroup and return an event
// from its queue. Ideally the heuristic should give precedence to
// SchedulerGroups corresponding to the foreground tabs. The correctness of this
// data structure relies on the invariant that events from different
// SchedulerGroups cannot affect each other.

  // The basic problem here is to keep track of the ordering relationships
  // between events. As long as there are only labeled events, there can be one
  // queue per SchedulerGroup. However, if an unlabeled event is pushed, we must
  // remember that it should run after all the labeled events currently in the
  // queue. To do this, the queues are arranged in "epochs". Each time the tail
  // of the queue transitions from labeled to unlabeled (or from unlabeled to
  // labeled) a new epoch starts. Events within different epochs are ordered
  // according to which epoch happened first. Within a labeled epoch, there is
  // one queue per SchedulerGroup. So events from different SchedulerGroups
  // within the same epoch are unordered with respect to each other. Within an
  // unlabeled epoch, there is a single queue that orders all the unlabeled
  // events.
  //
  // The data structures we use are:
  // 1. A queue of epochs. For each epoch, we store its epoch number. This
  // number is odd for labeled epochs and even for unlabeled epochs. We also
  // store the number of events in the epoch.
  // 2. A single queue for all unlabeled events. For each event in the queue, we
  // store the runnable as well as the epoch number.
  // 3. For labeled events, one queue for each SchedulerGroup. Each element in
  // these queues also keeps track of the epoch it belongs to.
  //
  // To push an event, we see if we can remain in the same epoch or if we have
  // to start a new one. If we have to start a new one, we push onto the epoch
  // queue. Then, based on whether the event is labeled or not, we push the
  // runnable and the epoch number into the appopriate queue.
  //
  // To pop an event, we look at the epoch at the front of the epoch queue. If
  // it is unlabeled, then we pop the first event in the unlabeled queue. If it
  // is labeled, we can pop from any of the SchedulerGroup queues. Then we
  // decrement the number of events in the current epoch. If this number reaches
  // zero, we pop from the epoch queue.
