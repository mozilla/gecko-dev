/**
 * Call aCallback for the C/C++ stack frames on the current thread, from
 * the caller of NS_StackWalk to main (or above).
 *
 * @param aCallback    Callback function, called once per frame.
 * @param aSkipFrames  Number of initial frames to skip.  0 means that
 *                     the first callback will be for the caller of
 *                     NS_StackWalk.
 * @param aMaxFrames   Maximum number of frames to trace.  0 means no limit.
 * @param aClosure     Caller-supplied data passed through to aCallback.
 * @param aThread      The thread for which the stack is to be retrieved.
 *                     Passing null causes us to walk the stack of the
 *                     current thread. On Windows, this is a thread HANDLE.
 *                     It is currently not supported on any other platform.
 * @param aPlatformData Platform specific data that can help in walking the
 *                      stack, this should be nullptr unless you really know
 *                      what you're doing! This needs to be a pointer to a
 *                      CONTEXT on Windows and should not be passed on other
 *                      platforms.
 *
 * Return values:
 * - NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.  Occurs on platforms where it is unimplemented.
 *
 * - NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED.  Occurs when the stack indicates that the thread
 *   is in a very dangerous situation (e.g., holding sem_pool_lock in Mac OS X
 *   pthreads code).  Callers should then bail out immediately.
 *
 * - NS_ERROR_FAILURE.  Occurs when stack walking completely failed, i.e.
 *   aCallback was never called.
 *
 * - NS_OK.  Occurs when stack walking succeeded, i.e. aCallback was called at
 *   least once (and there was no need to exit with NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED).
 *
 * May skip some stack frames due to compiler optimizations or code
 * generation.
