  // Inter-process memory reporting proceeds as follows.
  //
  // - GetReports() (declared within NS_DECL_NSIMEMORYREPORTERMANAGER)
  //   synchronously gets memory reports for the current process, tells all
  //   child processes to get memory reports, and sets up some state
  //   (mGetReportsState) for when the child processes report back, including a
  //   timer.  Control then returns to the main event loop.
  //
  // - HandleChildReports() is called (asynchronously) once per child process
  //   that reports back.  If all child processes report back before time-out,
  //   the timer is cancelled.  (The number of child processes is part of the
  //   saved request state.)
  //
  // - TimeoutCallback() is called (asynchronously) if all the child processes
  //   don't respond within the time threshold.
  //
  // - FinishReporting() finishes things off.  It is *always* called -- either
  //   from HandleChildReports() (if all child processes have reported back) or
  //   from TimeoutCallback() (if time-out occurs).
  //
  // All operations occur on the main thread.
  //
  // The above sequence of steps is a "request".  A partially-completed request
  // is described as "in flight".
  //
  // Each request has a "generation", a unique number that identifies it.  This
  // is used to ensure that each reports from a child process corresponds to
  // the appropriate request from the parent process.  (It's easier to
  // implement a generation system than to implement a child report request
  // cancellation mechanism.)
  //
  // Failures are mostly ignored, because it's (a) typically the most sensible
  // thing to do, and (b) often hard to do anything else.  The following are
  // the failure cases of note.
  //
  // - If a request is made while the previous request is in flight, the new
  //   request is ignored, as per getReports()'s specification.  No error is
  //   reported, because the previous request will complete soon enough.
  //
  // - If one or more child processes fail to respond within the time limit,
  //   things will proceed as if they don't exist.  No error is reported,
  //   because partial information is better than nothing.
  //
  // - If a child process reports after the time-out occurs, it is ignored.
  //   (Generation checking will ensure it is ignored even if a subsequent
  //   request is in flight;  this is the main use of generations.)  No error
  //   is reported, because there's nothing sensible to be done about it at
  //   this late stage.
  //
  // Now, what what happens if a child process is created/destroyed in the
  // middle of a request?  Well, GetReportsState contains a copy of
  // mNumChildProcesses which it uses to determine finished-ness.  So...
  //
  // - If a process is created, it won't have received the request for reports,
  //   and the GetReportsState's mNumChildProcesses won't account for it.  So
  //   the reported data will reflect how things were when the request began.
  //
  // - If a process is destroyed before reporting back, we'll just hit the
  //   time-out, because we'll have received reports (barring other errors)
  //   from N-1 child process.  So the reported data will reflect how things
  //   are when the request ends.
  //
  // - If a process is destroyed after reporting back, but before all other
  //   child processes have reported back, it will be included in the reported
  //   data.  So the reported data will reflect how things were when the
  //   request began.
  //
  // The inconsistencies between these three cases are unfortunate but
  // difficult to avoid.  It's enough of an edge case to not be worth doing
  // more.
