/**
 * MODULE NOTES:
 *
 * The Deque is a very small, very efficient container object
 * than can hold elements of type void*, offering the following features:
 *    Its interface supports pushing and popping of elements.
 *    It can iterate (via an interator class) its elements.
 *    When full, it can efficiently resize dynamically.
 *
 *
 * NOTE: The only bit of trickery here is that this deque is
 * built upon a ring-buffer. Like all ring buffers, the first
 * element may not be at index[0]. The mOrigin member determines
 * where the first child is. This point is quietly hidden from
 * customers of this class.
