/** 
 * Macro to free all elements of an XPCOM array of a given size using

 *
 * Note that this macro (and its wrappers) can be used to deallocate a
 * partially- or completely-built array while unwinding an error
 * condition inside the XPCOM routine that was going to return the
 * array.  For this to work on a partially-built array, your code
 * needs to be building the array from index 0 upwards, and simply
 * pass the number of elements that have already been built (and thus
 * need to be freed) as |size|.
 *
 * Thanks to <alecf@netscape.com> for suggesting this form, which
 * allows the macro to be used with NS_RELEASE / NS_RELEASE_IF in
 * addition to nsMemory::Free.
 * 
 * @param size      Number of elements in the array.  If not a constant, this 
 *                  should be a int32_t.  Note that this means this macro 
 *                  will not work if size >= 2^31.
 * @param array     The array to be freed.
 * @param freeFunc  The function or macro to be used to free it. 
 *                  For arrays of nsISupports (or any class derived
 *                  from it), NS_IF_RELEASE (or NS_RELEASE) should be
 *                  passed as freeFunc.  For most (all?) other pointer
 *                  types (including XPCOM strings and wstrings),
 *                  nsMemory::Free should be used, since the
 *                  shared-allocator (nsMemory) is what will have been
 *                  used to allocate the memory.
