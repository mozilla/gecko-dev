- DOCS
- improve error handling
  - should some errors really be warnings?
  - should autoreg support additional channel to receive warnings so that
    an installer can decide whether or not to accept the consequences of 
    leaving the newly installed files in place?
- verification of interfaces (warnings and/or errors)
  - verify that repeated interfaces are identical in all ways
  - verify that interface names are always one-to-one with iids    
- check for truncated xpt files and version problems
  - http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33193
- TESTS!
   - e.g. verify the merge stuff really works for various inputs.
   - we really need a set of .xpt and .zip files and code that does an array 
     of autoreg and interfaceinof use activitities to test various corners
     of the system.
- better autoreg logging
- use only 32 bits for file size?
