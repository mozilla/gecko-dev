/**
 * Implementation of a triple box blur approximation of a Gaussian blur.
 *
 * A Gaussian blur is good for blurring because, when done independently
 * in the horizontal and vertical directions, it matches the result that
 * would be obtained using a different (rotated) set of axes.  A triple
 * box blur is a very close approximation of a Gaussian.
 *
 * Creates an 8-bit alpha channel context for callers to draw in,
 * spreads the contents of that context, blurs the contents, and applies
 * it as an alpha mask on a different existing context.
 * 
 * A spread N makes each output pixel the maximum value of all source
 * pixels within a square of side length 2N+1 centered on the output pixel.
 * 
 * A temporary surface is created in the Init function. The caller then draws
 * any desired content onto the context acquired through GetContext, and lastly
 * calls Paint to apply the blurred content as an alpha mask.
