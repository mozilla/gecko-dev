/**
 * Different elements of a web pages are rendered into separate "layers" before
 * they are flattened into the final image that is brought to the screen.
 * See Layers.h for more informations about layers and why we use retained
 * structures.
 * Most of the documentation for layers is directly in the source code in the
 * form of doc comments. An overview can also be found in the the wiki:
 * https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Overview#Graphics
 *
 *
 * # Main interfaces and abstractions
 *
 *  - Layer, ShadowableLayer and LayerComposite
 *    (see Layers.h and ipc/ShadowLayers.h)
 *  - CompositableClient and CompositableHost
 *    (client/CompositableClient.h composite/CompositableHost.h)
 *  - TextureClient and TextureHost
 *    (client/TextureClient.h composite/TextureHost.h)
 *  - TextureSource
 *    (composite/TextureHost.h)
 *  - Forwarders
 *    (ipc/CompositableForwarder.h ipc/ShadowLayers.h)
 *  - Compositor
 *    (this file)
 *  - IPDL protocols
 *    (.ipdl files under the gfx/layers/ipc directory)
 *
 * The *Client and Shadowable* classes are always used on the content thread.
 * Forwarders are always used on the content thread.
 * The *Host and Shadow* classes are always used on the compositor thread.
 * Compositors, TextureSource, and Effects are always used on the compositor
 * thread.
 * Most enums and constants are declared in LayersTypes.h and CompositorTypes.h.
 *
 *
 * # Texture transfer
 *
 * Most layer classes own a Compositable plus some extra information like
 * transforms and clip rects. They are platform independent.
 * Compositable classes manipulate Texture objects and are reponsible for
 * things like tiling, buffer rotation or double buffering. Compositables
 * are also platform-independent. Examples of compositable classes are:
 *  - ImageClient
 *  - CanvasClient
 *  - ContentHost
 *  - etc.
 * Texture classes (TextureClient and TextureHost) are thin abstractions over
 * platform-dependent texture memory. They are maniplulated by compositables
 * and don't know about buffer rotations and such. The purposes of TextureClient
 * and TextureHost are to synchronize, serialize and deserialize texture data.
 * TextureHosts provide access to TextureSources that are views on the
 * Texture data providing the necessary api for Compositor backend to composite
 * them.
 *
 * Compositable and Texture clients and hosts are created using factory methods.
 * They should only be created by using their constructor in exceptional
 * circumstances. The factory methods are located:
 *    TextureClient       - CompositableClient::CreateTextureClient
 *    TextureHost         - TextureHost::CreateTextureHost, which calls a
 *                          platform-specific function, e.g., CreateTextureHostOGL
 *    CompositableClient  - in the appropriate subclass, e.g.,
 *                          CanvasClient::CreateCanvasClient
 *    CompositableHost    - CompositableHost::Create
 *
 *
 * # IPDL
 *
 * If off-main-thread compositing (OMTC) is enabled, compositing is performed
 * in a dedicated thread. In some setups compositing happens in a dedicated
 * process. Documentation may refer to either the compositor thread or the
 * compositor process.
 * See explanations in ShadowLayers.h.
 *
 *
 * # Backend implementations
 *
 * Compositor backends like OpenGL or flavours of D3D live in their own directory
 * under gfx/layers/. To add a new backend, implement at least the following
 * interfaces:
 * - Compositor (ex. CompositorOGL)
 * - TextureHost (ex. SurfaceTextureHost)
 * Depending on the type of data that needs to be serialized, you may need to
 * add specific TextureClient implementations.

/**
 * Common interface for compositor backends.
 *
 * Compositor provides a cross-platform interface to a set of operations for
 * compositing quads. Compositor knows nothing about the layer tree. It must be
 * told everything about each composited quad - contents, location, transform,
 * opacity, etc.
 *
 * In theory it should be possible for different widgets to use the same
 * compositor. In practice, we use one compositor per window.
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * For an example of a user of Compositor, see LayerManagerComposite.
 *
 * Initialization: create a Compositor object, call Initialize().
 *
 * Destruction: destroy any resources associated with the compositor, call
 * Destroy(), delete the Compositor object.
 *
 * Composition:
 *  call BeginFrame,
 *  for each quad to be composited:
 *    call MakeCurrent if necessary (not necessary if no other context has been
 *      made current),
 *    take care of any texture upload required to composite the quad, this step
 *      is backend-dependent,
 *    construct an EffectChain for the quad,
 *    call DrawQuad,
 *  call EndFrame.
 * If the compositor is usually used for compositing but compositing is
 * temporarily done without the compositor, call EndFrameForExternalComposition
 * after compositing each frame so the compositor can remain internally
 * consistent.
 *
 * By default, the compositor will render to the screen, to render to a target,
 * call SetTargetContext or SetRenderTarget, the latter with a target created
 * by CreateRenderTarget or CreateRenderTargetFromSource.
 *
 * The target and viewport methods can be called before any DrawQuad call and
 * affect any subsequent DrawQuad calls.
