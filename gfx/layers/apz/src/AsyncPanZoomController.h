/**
 * Controller for all panning and zooming logic. Any time a user input is
 * detected and it must be processed in some way to affect what the user sees,
 * it goes through here. Listens for any input event from InputData and can
 * optionally handle WidgetGUIEvent-derived touch events, but this must be done
 * on the main thread. Note that this class completely cross-platform.
 *
 * Input events originate on the UI thread of the platform that this runs on,
 * and are then sent to this class. This class processes the event in some way;
 * for example, a touch move will usually lead to a panning of content (though
 * of course there are exceptions, such as if content preventDefaults the event,
 * or if the target frame is not scrollable). The compositor interacts with this
 * class by locking it and querying it for the current transform matrix based on
 * the panning and zooming logic that was invoked on the UI thread.
 *
 * Currently, each outer DOM window (i.e. a website in a tab, but not any
 * subframes) has its own AsyncPanZoomController. In the future, to support
 * asynchronously scrolled subframes, we want to have one AsyncPanZoomController
 * per frame.
