 *
 * To avoid deadlock, we impose a lock ordering between these locks, which is:
 *

/**
 * This class manages the tree of AsyncPanZoomController instances. There is one

 * many AsyncPanZoomController instances as there are scrollable container layers.
 * This class generally lives on the compositor thread, although some functions
 * may be called from other threads as noted; thread safety is ensured internally.
 *
 * The bulk of the work of this class happens as part of the UpdateHitTestingTree
 * function, which is when a layer tree update is received by the compositor.
 * This function walks through the layer tree and creates a tree of
 * HitTestingTreeNode instances to match the layer tree and for use in
 * hit-testing on the controller thread. APZC instances may be preserved across
 * calls to this function if the corresponding layers are still present in the layer
 * tree.
 *
 * The other functions on this class are used by various pieces of client code to
 * notify the APZC instances of events relevant to them. This includes, for example,
 * user input events that drive panning and zooming, changes to the scroll viewport
 * area, and changes to pan/zoom constraints.
 *
 * Note that the ClearTree function MUST be called when this class is no longer needed;
 * see the method documentation for details.
 *
 * Behaviour of APZ is controlled by a number of preferences shown \ref APZCPrefs "here".

   *   than a displacement because with certain 3D transforms, the same
   *   displacement between different points in transformed coordinates can
   *   represent different displacements in untransformed coordinates.
   * |aOverscrollHandoffChain| is the overscroll handoff chain used for
   *   determining the order in which scroll should be handed off between
   *   APZCs
   * |aOverscrollHandoffChainIndex| is the next position in the overscroll
   *   handoff chain that should be scrolled.
   *
   * Returns true iff. some APZC accepted the scroll and scrolled.
   * This is to allow the sending APZC to go into an overscrolled state if
   * no APZC further up in the handoff chain accepted the overscroll.
   *
   * The way this method works is best illustrated with an example.
   * Consider three nested APZCs, A, B, and C, with C being the innermost one.
   * Say B is scroll-grabbing.
   * The touch events go to C because it's the innermost one (so e.g. taps
   * should go through C), but the overscroll handoff chain is B -> C -> A
   * because B is scroll-grabbing.
   * For convenience I'll refer to the three APZC objects as A, B, and C, and
   * to the tree manager object as TM.
   * Here's what happens when C receives a touch-move event:
   *   - C.TrackTouch() calls TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 0.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() calls B.AttemptScroll() (since B is at index 0 in the chain).
   *   - B.AttemptScroll() scrolls B. If there is overscroll, it calls TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 1.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() calls C.AttemptScroll() (since C is at index 1 in the chain)
   *   - C.AttemptScroll() scrolls C. If there is overscroll, it calls TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 2.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() calls A.AttemptScroll() (since A is at index 2 in the chain)
   *   - A.AttemptScroll() scrolls A. If there is overscroll, it calls TM.DispatchScroll() with index = 3.
   *   - TM.DispatchScroll() discards the rest of the scroll as there are no more elements in the chain.

   *               hit-testing subtree corresponding to the layer subtree rooted
   *               at aLayer.
   * @param aLayersId The layers id of the layer in aLayer.
   * @param aAncestorTransform The accumulated CSS transforms of all the
   *                           layers from aLayer up (via the parent chain)
   *                           to the next APZC-bearing layer.
   * @param aParent The parent of any node built at this level.
   * @param aNextSibling The next sibling of any node built at this level.
   * @return The HitTestingTreeNode created at this level. This will always
   *         be non-null.
