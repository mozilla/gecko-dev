/**
 * Many platforms have dedicated hardware for simple composition.
 * This hardware is usually faster or more power efficient than the
 * GPU.  However, in exchange for this better performance, generality
 * has to be sacrificed: no 3d transforms, no intermediate surfaces,
 * no special shader effects, loss of other goodies depending on the
 * platform.
 *
 * Composer2D is a very simple interface to this class of hardware
 * that allows an implementation to "try rendering" with the fast
 * path.  If the given layer tree requires more generality than the
 * hardware provides, the implementation should bail and have the
 * layer manager fall back on full GPU composition.
