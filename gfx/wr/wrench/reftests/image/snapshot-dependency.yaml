# This test contains a snapshotted stacking context which is defined
# in a less "nested" part of the document than the image that displays
# it (using a stack of filters to nest the image in multiple render
# passes).
# Without special care to render the snapshot before the image,
# WebRender's render task graph would schedule the most nested part
# first, causing the snapshot to be drawn too late.
