# This test case contains a snapshotted picture with a single
# child stacking context with a clip applied. In the general
# clips are hoisted out of picture if all of their children share
# it, but we rely on the clip being baked in the snapshot so
# This test should that snapshotted picture and the snapshot image
# both affected by the clip.
