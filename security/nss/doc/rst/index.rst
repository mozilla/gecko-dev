   **Network Security Services** (**NSS**) is a set of libraries designed to
   support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
   applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSL v3, TLS, PKCS #5,
   PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other
   security standards.

   NSS is available under the Mozilla Public License v2 (MPLv2).
