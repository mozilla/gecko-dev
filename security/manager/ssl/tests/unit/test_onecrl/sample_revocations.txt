# a sample revocations.txt for tests
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored - as are empty lines like this:

# otherwise:
# non-empty lines are treated as base-64 encoded DER DN data (e.g. issuer or
# subject)
# ...unless the line starts with a ' ' (space) character, in which case it's
# assumed to be base-64 encoded DER serial data, or
# the line starts with a '\t' (tab) character, in which case it's assumed to
# be a base-64 encoded SHA256 hash of a public key

# First a serial with no issuer to ensure this doesn't cause parsing to fail
# (there should be an issuer first, but we need to test this won't fail)
 dGVzdA==
# next, let's ensure data that isn't valid base64 doesn't cause breakage.
 this serial isn't valid base64 (but then there's no issuer anyway)
Neither is this issuer, though the serial is fine

dGVzdA==
 in this case, issuer is fine but not the serial
# Next two entries; we can add valid base-64 encoded data for some basic tests:
# issuer is "some imaginary issuer" base-64 encoded
# and serial "serial." base-64 encoded
