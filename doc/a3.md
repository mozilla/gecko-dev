# Bug 513180 : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513180

## Diagnosis
- In the Mozilla Firefox browser search bar, you can configure certain preferences for your browser.
- If you type in "about:config" in the address bar, you can make these configurations. If you want your search to always open in a new tab, then you can set "browser.search.openintab" to true.
- After setting this to true, your search should open in a new tab when you click enter or click the search button.
- Issue: Currently, search only opens in a new tab when you click enter but opens in the same tab when the search button is clicked.
- Benefit of Fixing Bug: Fixing the bug will ensure consistency in the search bar with regards to both mouse and keyboard search methods. It will also allow the user to be feel more in control and trust that his/her personal browser configurations work to satisfaction
- Risk: I don't think there is a huge risk associated with this bug because it has to do with a special browser configuration and it also already works with the 'enter' button.

## Proposed Solution
- Go into Mozilla browser files for search bar.
- Locate the method that handles search bar configurations.
- Identify the block of code that opens a new tab for the keyboard 'enter' button.
- Add an extra block that does the same for Mouse click events.

## Testing Process
- Run Mozilla Firefox browser
- In the address bar, type in "about:config"
- Set "browser.search.openintab" to true
- Types some words in the search bar
- Before: Results will be displayed in the same tab
- After: Results will be displayed in a new tab
