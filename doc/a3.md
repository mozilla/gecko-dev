## Diagnosis of your bug. Describe in English what the issue is, and what the benefit of fixing will bring. What risks are there, if any?

The bugzilla bug selected aims to update the propTypes for the React component ToolBar. PropTypes such as censusDisplays and dominatorTreeDisplays are used in other components so they have been made into specific models. Updating the current propType will avoid DRY principle and also enforce the objects passed into the component are correct. The risk are that an incorrect fix would cause the component to be unusable. 

## Propose a solution. Describe in English what you’d do, and the step by step process you’d follow. The goal is to present your reasoning to the person who would be evaluating your patch.

1. Export the models that are used by ToolBars
2. Import these models in ToolBar
3. Update the propTypes in Toolbar
4. Run `./mach test devtools/client/memory/` to ensure nothing breaks and other components are not affected

## Testing document - A process (or description of a process) by which you’d evaluate the success of your work.  (See Note 1) How do you know your change addresses the bug?

We can check if the component is behaving correctly by running `./mach test devtools/client/memory/`
