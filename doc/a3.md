## Diagnosis 
The [LLVM Standards](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability-else-after-return.html) say that for better readability, indentations should be reduced, by avoiding the use of `else` or `else if` immidiately after something interrupts control in the program (ie `return`, `break`, `exit`, etc.). In `firefox-source/intl/lwbrk/WordBreaker.cpp`, this isn't followed as there are several `else if` and `else` statements that follow `return` statements. Fixing this bug will improve readability of the code. 

## Solution
I would go through `firefox-source/intl/lwbrk/WordBreaker.cpp` and for each `else` or `else if` statement following a `return`, I'd convert it simply to an `if` statement (if it was an `else if`), or simply remove the `else` (if it was an `else` statement). 

## Testing
As I am simply reformatting the code, the testing procedures need not change. The change can be verified by viewing the updated file.
