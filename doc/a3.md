 **Bug Diagnosis:** 
 
 this bug occurs when you open a pdf on the firefox browser, then press full screen or presentation mode. A pop up message with say "PDF is now full screen" which is not appropriate or the best option.
 
 **Before fix**

**Bug Solution:**
I navigated to the portion of the code that had the popup message when putting anything into fullscreen mode. I found that to be on line 105 of browser.dtd. I then changed the message from the original to a more appropriate one.

- Go to 'https://www.sanface.com/pdf/test.pdf#page=2&zoom=auto,0,829' or any url in which a pdf is displayed.
- Click the full screen button
- watch for the popup message that is the bug
