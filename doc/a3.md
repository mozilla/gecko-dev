Good First Bug
1. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488411

2. The bug occurs when you access the about:policies page, if you change the url in the same tab to about:policies#documentation the page will still show as about:policies#active, not about:policies#documentation. Fixing the bug will bring benefit for the user since this is incorrect behaviour. If the user navigates through the url to  about:policies#documentation the user should expect the documentation for about:policies

3. There is specific files for about:policies I found for the page. I added lines in the javascript file so the window can check if there's a change with the location hash. If there is, the page will change based on the location hash that was given.

4. The testing I have done is to type in the url about:policies and then about:policies#documentation in the url bar of the same tab and see if the documentation section is shown.

5. Screenshots: all changed through the url in the same tab, under folder screenshots
