##Diagnosis
###Problem
If the firefox nightly build is being run on "work offline" mode and someone attempts to access "About Nightly" under the help dropdown menu in the menubar, the about menu still checks for updates. This check fails as firefox is in offline mode and does not access the internet. Thus a default message of the build being up to date is displayed. This can be viewed as misleading and pointless as the build should know that the offline mode is activated and should not attempt to connect to the update server.

###Benefit
The reporter of the bug noticed the issue while working on the permanent offline mode. However he forgot that his buld was working offline when he accessed the about menu and was thus mislead into believing his build was upto date. The incident could repeat with future developers who are testing the nightly build in offline mode. Furthermore, trying to access the update server despite knowing that the build is in offline mode can be an exploitable security vulnerability in the future as it could reveal the queries which are necessary to access firefox's update server by inducing an error. Thus fixing this issue will remove a potential pitfall for developers working on with the offline mode and could potentially fix a security vulnerability as well.
