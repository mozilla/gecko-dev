**DIAGNOSIS:**

In this bug, the issue is that `console.log()` on objects that are array-like returns arrays. For instance, if one tries to `console.log({0:10})`, they would get `[10]` instead of `{0:10}`. This is confusing to developers and would be very helpful to fix the bug such that `console.log()` returns objects when objects are passed instead of modifying them into arrays. This would also be consistent with other browsers such as google chrome.The function `pseudoArray()` in the previewers.js file under the object folder checks for objects that qualify as pseudo arrays and returns true so that such objects can be converted to arrays.This function needs to be modified such that there is no check for pseudo-arrays on objects passed to `console.log()`.Tests for this feature are in the file `test_objectgrips-array-like-object.js` under unit tests in the server folder in devtools. After fixing the issue, the existing tests for this feature need to be removed from the code.These tests are in `test_objectgrips-array-like-object.js`.
                                  
**SOLUTION:**

To fix this bug, I have modified the `pseudoArray()` function such that it does not convert objects into arrays. I did this by returning false within the function if the passed object has a length greater than 0. I have also removed the tests that relate to this feature.The removal of such tests is done in the file `server/tests/unit/test_objectgrips-array-like-object.js` under the devtools folder.
                                  
                                  
 **TESTING:**
 * Run `./mach build` to confirm that the code still builds without errors.
 * Run `./mach test ...` to confirm that the changes didn't lead to test failures.
