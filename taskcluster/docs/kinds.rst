Task Kinds
==========

This section lists and documents the available task kinds.

build
-----

Builds are tasks that produce an installer or other output that can be run by
users or automated tests.  This is more restrictive than most definitions of
"build" in a Mozilla context: it does not include tasks that run build-like
actions for static analysis or to produce instrumented artifacts.

build-extensions
----------------

Builds Firefox extensions with `mach build`.

build-fat-aar
-------------

Build architecture-independent GeckoView AAR (Android ARchive) files. This build-like tasks is an
artifact build (ARMv7, but this is arbitrary) that itself depends on arch-specific Android build
jobs. It fetches arch-specific AAR files, extracts arch-specific libraries and preference files,
and then assembles a multi-architecture "fat AAR". Downstream consumers are expected to use
per-ABI feature splits to produce arch-specific APKs.

If you want to run this task locally, you need to specify these environment variable:
  - MOZ_ANDROID_FAT_AAR_ARCHITECTURES: must be a comma-separated list of architecture.
    Eg: "armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a,x86,x86_64".
  - each of MOZ_ANDROID_FAT_AAR_ARM64_V8A, MOZ_ANDROID_FAT_AAR_ARMEABI_V7A,
    MOZ_ANDROID_FAT_AAR_X86, MOZ_ANDROID_FAT_AAR_X86_64 must be a path relative to
    MOZ_FETCHES_DIR.

build-signing
-------------

Many builds must be signed. The build-signing task takes the unsigned `build`
kind artifacts and passes them through signingscriptworker to a signing server
and returns signed results.

build-mac-signing
-----------------

Mac signing without notarization.

Uses a self-signed certificate on level 1 environments.

Shippable downstream tasks should use artifacts from build-mac-notarization.

build-mac-notarization
----------------------

Mac notarization on signingscript (linux) using rcodesign.

Only available in production environments, as Apple doesn't offer a test
endpoint for notarizing apps.

Downstream tasks switch to build-mac-signing in non-shippable builds or level 1
environments.

artifact-build
--------------

This kind performs an artifact build: one based on precompiled binaries
discovered via the TaskCluster index.  This task verifies that such builds
continue to work correctly.

bootstrap
---------

This kind performs a standalone bootstrap of a Firefox build from various system environments.

hazard
------

Hazard builds are similar to "regular' builds, but use a compiler extension to
extract a bunch of data from the build and then analyze that data looking for
hazardous behaviors.

l10n
----

The l10n kind repacks a build (from the same source) for a subset of locales,
to exercise the localized repack logic in CI.

shippable-l10n
--------------

The nightly l10n kind repacks a shippable build (from the same source code)
in order to provide localized versions of the same source.

shippable-l10n-signing
----------------------

The shippable l10n signing kind takes artifacts from the shippable-l10n kind and
passes them to signing servers to have their contents signed appropriately, based
on an appropriate signing format. One signing job is created for each shippable-l10n
job (usually chunked).

shippable-l10n-mac-signing
--------------------------

Mac signing without notarization.

Uses a self-signed certificate on level 1 environments.

Shippable downstream tasks should use artifacts from build-mac-notarization.

shippable-l10n-mac-notarization
-------------------------------

Mac notarization on signingscript (linux) using rcodesign.

Only available in production environments, as Apple doesn't offer a test
endpoint for notarizing apps.

Downstream tasks switch to build-mac-signing in non-shippable builds or level 1
environments.

source-test
-----------

Source-tests are tasks that run directly from the Gecko source. This can include linting,
unit tests, source-code analysis, or measurement work. While source-test tasks run from
a source checkout, it is still possible for them to depend on a build artifact, though
often they do not.

code-review
-----------

Publish issues found by source-test tasks on Phabricator.
This is a part of Release Management code review Bot.

upload-symbols
--------------

Upload-symbols tasks run after builds and upload the symbols files generated by
build tasks to Socorro for later use in crash analysis.

upload-symbols-dummy
--------------------

Upload-symbols-dummy ensures both x64 and macosx64 tasks run for nightlies and releases.

upload-generated-sources
------------------------

Upload-generated-sources tasks run after builds and upload source files that were generated as part of the build process to an s3 bucket for later use in links from crash reports or when debugging shipped builds.

upload-generated-sources-dummy
------------------------------

Upload-generated-sources-dummy ensures both x64 and macosx64 tasks run for nightlies and releases.

valgrind
--------

Valgrind tasks produce builds instrumented by valgrind.

searchfox
---------

Searchfox builds generate C++ index data for Searchfox.

static-analysis-autotest
------------------------

Static analysis autotest utility in order to be sure that there is no regression
when upgrading utilities that impact static-analysis.

toolchain
---------

Toolchain builds create the compiler toolchains used to build Firefox.  These
will eventually be dependencies of the builds themselves, but for the moment
are run manually via try pushes and the results uploaded to tooltool.

spidermonkey
------------

Spidermonkey tasks check out the full gecko source tree, then compile only the
spidermonkey portion.  Each task runs specific tests after the build.

test
----

See the :doc:`test kind documentation <kinds/test>` for more info.

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   kinds/test


docker-image
------------

Tasks of the ``docker-image`` kind build the Docker images in which other
Docker tasks run.

The tasks to generate each docker image have predictable labels:
``docker-image-<name>``.

Docker images are built from subdirectories of ``taskcluster/docker``, using
``docker build``.  There is currently no capability for one Docker image to
depend on another in-tree docker image, without uploading the latter to a
Docker repository.

balrog
------

Balrog tasks are responsible for submitting metadata to our update server (Balrog).
They are typically downstream of a beetmover job that moves signed MARs somewhere
(eg: beetmover and beetmover-l10n for releases, beetmover-repackage for nightlies).

beetmover
---------

Beetmover, takes specific artifacts, "Beets", and pushes them to a location outside
of Taskcluster's task artifacts, (archive.mozilla.org as one place) and in the
process determines the final location and a "pretty" name (versioned product name)

beetmover-l10n
--------------

Beetmover L10n, takes specific artifacts, "Beets", and pushes them to a location outside
of Taskcluster's task artifacts, (archive.mozilla.org as one place) and in the
process determines the final location and a "pretty" name (versioned product name)
This separate kind uses logic specific to localized artifacts, such as including
the language in the final artifact names.

beetmover-repackage
-------------------

Beetmover-repackage is beetmover but for tasks that need an intermediate step
between signing and packaging, such as OSX. For more details see the definitions
of the Beetmover kind above and the repackage kind below.

release-beetmover-push-to-release
---------------------------------

release-beetmover-push-to-release publishes promoted releases from the
candidates directory to the release directory. This is part of release

beetmover-checksums
-------------------
Beetmover, takes specific artifact checksums and pushes it to a location outside
of Taskcluster's task artifacts (archive.mozilla.org as one place) and in the
process determines the final location and "pretty" names it (version product name)

release-beetmover-source-checksums
----------------------------------
Beetmover, takes source specific artifact checksums and pushes it to a location outside
of Taskcluster's task artifacts (archive.mozilla.org as one place) and in the
process determines the final location and "pretty" names it (version product name)

--------

release-balrog-submit-toplevel
