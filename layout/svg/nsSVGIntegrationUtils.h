   * In SVG, an element's "user space" is simply the coordinate system in place

   * to be applied to the union of the border-box rects of all of a given
   * frame's continuations. This means that, when we paint a non-SVG frame with
   * effects, we want to offset the effects by the distance from the frame's
   * origin (the top left of its border box) to the top left of the union of
   * the border-box rects of all its continuations. In other words, we need to
   * apply this offset as a suplimental translation to the current coordinate
   * system in order to establish the correct user space before calling into
   * the SVG effects code. For the purposes of the nsSVGIntegrationUtils code
   * we somewhat misappropriate the term "user space" by using it to refer
   * specifically to this adjusted coordinate system.
   *
   * For consistency with nsIFrame::GetOffsetTo, the offset this method returns
   * is the offset you need to add to a point that's relative to aFrame's
   * origin (the top left of its border box) to convert it to aFrame's user
   * space. In other words the value returned is actually the offset from the
   * origin of aFrame's user space to aFrame.
   *
   * Note: This method currently only accepts a frame's first continuation
   * since none of our current callers need to be able to pass in other
   * continuations.
