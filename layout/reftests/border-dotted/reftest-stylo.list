# DO NOT EDIT! This is a auto-generated temporary list for Stylo testing
# Composing dotted/dashed border rendering and not-filled or not-unfilled mask
# matches to full-filled box, using fuzzyy because of anti-aliasing.
# These check filled and unfilled regions with solid opaque color,
# so difference less than 80 is ignorable.
