# ParseCSS.cpp used to be built as a test program, but it was not
# being used for anything, and recent changes to the CSS loader have
# made it fail to link.  Further changes are planned which should make
# it buildable again.
#
# TestCSSPropertyLookup.cpp needs the internal XPCOM APIs and so cannot
# be built with libxul enabled.
