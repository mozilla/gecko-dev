// Internal Tracing API
//
// Tracing is an abstract visitation of each edge in a JS heap graph.[1] The
// most common (and performance sensitive) use of this infrastructure is for GC
// "marking" as part of the mark-and-sweep collector; however, this
// infrastructure is much more general than that and is used for many other
// purposes as well.
//
// One commonly misunderstood subtlety of the tracing architecture is the role
// of graph verticies versus graph edges. Graph verticies are the heap
// allocations -- GC things -- that are returned by Allocate. Graph edges are
// pointers -- including tagged pointers like Value and jsid -- that link the
// allocations into a complex heap. The tracing API deals *only* with edges.
// Any action taken on the target of a graph edge is independent to the tracing
// itself.
//
// Another common misunderstanding relates to the role of the JSTracer. The
// JSTracer instance determines what tracing does when visiting an edge; it
// does not itself participate in the tracing process, other than to be passed
// through as opaque data. It works like a closure in that respect.
//
// Tracing implementations internal to SpiderMonkey should use these interfaces
// instead of the public interfaces in js/TracingAPI.h. Unlike the public
// tracing methods, these work on internal types and avoid an external call.
//
// Note that the implementations for these methods are, surprisingly, in
// js/src/gc/Marking.cpp. This is so that the compiler can inline as much as
// possible in the common, marking pathways. Conceptually, however, they remain
// as part of the generic "tracing" architecture, rather than the more specific
// marking implementation of tracing.
//
// 1 - In SpiderMonkey, we call this concept tracing rather than visiting
//     because "visiting" is already used by the compiler. Also, it's been
//     called "tracing" forever and changing it would be extremely difficult at
//     this point.

// Trace through an edge in the live object graph on behalf of tracing. The
// effect of tracing the edge depends on the JSTracer being used.
