// Read Me First
//
// The ForkJoin abstraction:
// -------------------------
//
// This is the building block for executing multi-threaded JavaScript with
// shared memory (as distinct from Web Workers).  The idea is that you have
// some (typically data-parallel) operation which you wish to execute in
// parallel across as many threads as you have available.
//
// The ForkJoin abstraction is intended to be used by self-hosted code
// to enable parallel execution.  At the top-level, it consists of a native
// function (exposed as the ForkJoin intrinsic) that is used like so:
//
//     ForkJoin(func, feedback, N)
//
// The intention of this statement is to start |N| copies of |func()|
// running in parallel.  Each copy will then do more or less 1/Nth of
// the total work, depending on workstealing-based load balancing.
//
// Typically, each of the N slices runs in a different worker thread,
// but that is not something you should rely upon---if work-stealing
// is enabled it could be that a single worker thread winds up
// handling multiple slices.
//
// The second argument, |feedback|, is an optional callback that will
// receiver information about how execution proceeded.  This is
// intended for use in unit testing but also for providing feedback to
// users.  Note that gathering the data to provide to |feedback| is
// not free and so execution will run somewhat slower if |feedback| is
// provided.
//
// func() should expect the following arguments:
//
//     func(id, n, warmup)
//
// Here, |id| is the slice id. |n| is the total number of slices. The
// parameter |warmup| is true for a *warmup or recovery phase*.
// Warmup phases are discussed below in more detail, but the general
// idea is that if |warmup| is true, |func| should only do a fixed
// amount of work.  If |warmup| is false, |func| should try to do all
// remaining work is assigned.
//
// Note that we implicitly assume that |func| is tracking how much
// work it has accomplished thus far; some techniques for doing this
// are discussed in |ParallelArray.js|.
//
// Warmups and Sequential Fallbacks
// --------------------------------
//
// ForkJoin can only execute code in parallel when it has been
// ion-compiled in Parallel Execution Mode. ForkJoin handles this part
// for you. However, because ion relies on having decent type
// information available, it is necessary to run the code sequentially
// for a few iterations first to get the various type sets "primed"
// with reasonable information.  We try to make do with just a few
// runs, under the hypothesis that parallel execution code which reach
// type stability relatively quickly.
//
// The general strategy of ForkJoin is as follows:
//
// - If the code has not yet been run, invoke `func` sequentially with
//   warmup set to true.  When warmup is true, `func` should try and
//   do less work than normal---just enough to prime type sets. (See
//   ParallelArray.js for a discussion of specifically how we do this
//   in the case of ParallelArray).
//
// - Try to execute the code in parallel.  Parallel execution mode has
//   three possible results: success, fatal error, or bailout.  If a
//   bailout occurs, it means that the code attempted some action
//   which is not possible in parallel mode.  This might be a
//   modification to shared state, but it might also be that it
//   attempted to take some theoreticaly pure action that has not been
//   made threadsafe (yet?).
//
// - If parallel execution is successful, ForkJoin returns true.
//
// - If parallel execution results in a fatal error, ForkJoin returns false.
//
// - If parallel execution results in a *bailout*, this is when things
//   get interesting.  In that case, the semantics of parallel
//   execution guarantee us that no visible side effects have occurred
//   (unless they were performed with the intrinsic
//   |UnsafePutElements()|, which can only be used in self-hosted
//   code).  We therefore reinvoke |func()| but with warmup set to
//   true.  The idea here is that often parallel bailouts result from
//   a failed type guard or other similar assumption, so rerunning the
//   warmup sequentially gives us a chance to recompile with more
//   data.  Because warmup is true, we do not expect this sequential
//   call to process all remaining data, just a chunk.  After this
//   recovery execution is complete, we again attempt parallel
//   execution.
//
// - If more than a fixed number of bailouts occur, we give up on
//   parallelization and just invoke |func()| N times in a row (once
//   for each worker) but with |warmup| set to false.
//
// Operation callback:
//
// During parallel execution, |cx.check()| must be periodically
// invoked to check for the operation callback. This is automatically
// done by the Ion-generated code. If the operation callback is
// necessary, |cx.check()| abort the parallel execution.
//
// Transitive compilation:
//
// One of the challenges for parallel compilation is that we
// (currently) have to abort when we encounter an uncompiled script.
// Therefore, we try to compile everything that might be needed
// beforehand. The exact strategy is described in `ParallelDo::apply()`
// in ForkJoin.cpp, but at the highest level the idea is:
//
// 1. We maintain a flag on every script telling us if that script and
//    its transitive callees are believed to be compiled. If that flag
//    is set, we can skip the initial compilation.
// 2. Otherwise, we maintain a worklist that begins with the main
//    script. We compile it and then examine the generated parallel IonScript,
//    which will have a list of callees. We enqueue those. Some of these
//    compilations may take place off the main thread, in which case
//    we will run warmup iterations while we wait for them to complete.
// 3. If the warmup iterations finish all the work, we're done.
// 4. If compilations fail, we fallback to sequential.
// 5. Otherwise, we will try running in parallel once we're all done.
//
// Bailout tracing and recording:
//
// When a bailout occurs, we record a bit of state so that we can
// recover with grace. Each |ForkJoinContext| has a pointer to a
// |ParallelBailoutRecord| pre-allocated for this purpose. This
// structure is used to record the cause of the bailout, the JSScript
// which was executing, as well as the location in the source where
// the bailout occurred (in principle, we can record a full stack
// trace, but right now we only record the top-most frame). Note that
// the error location might not be in the same JSScript as the one
// which was executing due to inlining.
//
// Garbage collection and allocation:
//
// Code which executes on these parallel threads must be very careful
// with respect to garbage collection and allocation.  The typical
// allocation paths are UNSAFE in parallel code because they access
// shared state (the compartment's arena lists and so forth) without
// any synchronization.  They can also trigger GC in an ad-hoc way.
//
// To deal with this, the forkjoin code creates a distinct |Allocator|
// object for each slice.  You can access the appropriate object via
// the |ForkJoinContext| object that is provided to the callbacks.  Once
// the execution is complete, all the objects found in these distinct
// |Allocator| is merged back into the main compartment lists and
// things proceed normally.
//
// In Ion-generated code, we will do allocation through the
// |Allocator| found in |ForkJoinContext| (which is obtained via TLS).
// Also, no write barriers are emitted.  Conceptually, we should never
// need a write barrier because we only permit writes to objects that
// are newly allocated, and such objects are always black (to use
// incremental GC terminology).  However, to be safe, we also block
// upon entering a parallel section to ensure that any concurrent
// marking or incremental GC has completed.
//
// In the future, it should be possible to lift the restriction that
// we must block until inc. GC has completed and also to permit GC
// during parallel exeution. But we're not there yet.
//
// Load balancing (work stealing):

// The ForkJoin job is dynamically divided into a fixed number of slices,
// and is submitted for parallel execution in the pool. When the number
// of slices is big enough (typically greater than the number of workers
// in the pool) -and the workload is unbalanced- each worker thread
// will perform load balancing through work stealing. The number
// of slices is computed by the self-hosted function |ComputeNumSlices|
// and can be used to know how many slices will be executed by the
// runtime for an array of the given size.
//
// Current Limitations:
//
// - The API does not support recursive or nested use.  That is, the
//   JavaScript function given to |ForkJoin| should not itself invoke
//   |ForkJoin()|. Instead, use the intrinsic |InParallelSection()| to
//   check for recursive use and execute a sequential fallback.
