///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Read Me First
//
// The ForkJoin abstraction:
// -------------------------
//
// This is the building block for executing multi-threaded JavaScript with
// shared memory (as distinct from Web Workers).  The idea is that you have
// some (typically data-parallel) operation which you wish to execute in
// parallel across as many threads as you have available.
//
// The ForkJoin abstraction is intended to be used by self-hosted code
// to enable parallel execution.  At the top-level, it consists of a native
// function (exposed as the ForkJoin intrinsic) that is used like so:
//
//     ForkJoin(func, sliceStart, sliceEnd, mode, updatable)
//
// The intention of this statement is to start some some number (usually the
// number of hardware threads) of copies of |func()| running in parallel. Each
// copy will then do a portion of the total work, depending on
// workstealing-based load balancing.
//
// Typically, each of the N slices runs in a different worker thread, but that
// is not something you should rely upon---if work-stealing is enabled it
// could be that a single worker thread winds up handling multiple slices.
//
// The second and third arguments, |sliceStart| and |sliceEnd|, are the slice
// boundaries. These numbers must each fit inside an uint16_t.
//
// The fourth argument, |mode|, is an internal mode integer giving finer
// control over the behavior of ForkJoin. See the |ForkJoinMode| enum.
//
// The fifth argument, |updatable|, if not null, is an object that may
// be updated in a race-free manner by |func()| or its callees.
// Typically this is some sort of pre-sized array.  Only this object
// may be updated by |func()|, and updates must not race.  (A more
// general approach is perhaps desirable, eg passing an Array of
// objects that may be updated, but that is not presently needed.)
//
// func() should expect the following arguments:
//
//     func(workerId, sliceStart, sliceEnd)
//
// The |workerId| parameter is the id of the worker executing the function. It
// is 0 in sequential mode.
//
// The |sliceStart| and |sliceEnd| parameters are the current bounds that that
// the worker is handling. In parallel execution, these parameters are not
// used. In sequential execution, they tell the worker what slices should be
// processed. During the warm up phase, sliceEnd == sliceStart + 1.
//
// |func| can keep asking for more work from the scheduler by calling the
// intrinsic |GetForkJoinSlice(sliceStart, sliceEnd, id)|. When there are no
// more slices to hand out, ThreadPool::MAX_SLICE_ID is returned as a sentinel
// value. By exposing this function as an intrinsic, we reduce the number of
// JS-C++ boundary crossings incurred by workstealing, which may have many
// slices.
//
// In sequential execution, |func| should return the maximum computed slice id
// S for which all slices with id < S have already been processed. This is so
// ThreadPool can track the leftmost completed slice id to maintain
// determinism. Slices which have been completed in sequential execution
// cannot be re-run in parallel execution.
//
// In parallel execution, |func| MUST PROCESS ALL SLICES BEFORE RETURNING!
// Not doing so is an error and is protected by debug asserts in ThreadPool.
//
// Warmups and Sequential Fallbacks
// --------------------------------
//
// ForkJoin can only execute code in parallel when it has been
// ion-compiled in Parallel Execution Mode. ForkJoin handles this part
// for you. However, because ion relies on having decent type
// information available, it is necessary to run the code sequentially
// for a few iterations first to get the various type sets "primed"
// with reasonable information.  We try to make do with just a few
// runs, under the hypothesis that parallel execution code which reach
// type stability relatively quickly.
//
// The general strategy of ForkJoin is as follows:
//
// - If the code has not yet been run, invoke `func` sequentially with
//   warmup set to true.  When warmup is true, `func` should try and
//   do less work than normal---just enough to prime type sets. (See
//   ParallelArray.js for a discussion of specifically how we do this
//   in the case of ParallelArray).
//
// - Try to execute the code in parallel.  Parallel execution mode has
//   three possible results: success, fatal error, or bailout.  If a
//   bailout occurs, it means that the code attempted some action
//   which is not possible in parallel mode.  This might be a
//   modification to shared state, but it might also be that it
//   attempted to take some theoreticaly pure action that has not been
//   made threadsafe (yet?).
//
// - If parallel execution is successful, ForkJoin returns true.
//
// - If parallel execution results in a fatal error, ForkJoin returns false.
//
// - If parallel execution results in a *bailout*, this is when things
//   get interesting.  In that case, the semantics of parallel
//   execution guarantee us that no visible side effects have occurred
//   (unless they were performed with the intrinsic
//   |UnsafePutElements()|, which can only be used in self-hosted
//   code).  We therefore reinvoke |func()| but with warmup set to
//   true.  The idea here is that often parallel bailouts result from
//   a failed type guard or other similar assumption, so rerunning the
//   warmup sequentially gives us a chance to recompile with more
//   data.  Because warmup is true, we do not expect this sequential
//   call to process all remaining data, just a chunk.  After this
//   recovery execution is complete, we again attempt parallel
//   execution.
//
// - If more than a fixed number of bailouts occur, we give up on
//   parallelization and just invoke |func()| N times in a row (once
//   for each worker) but with |warmup| set to false.
//
// Interrupts:
//
// During parallel execution, |cx.check()| must be periodically invoked to
// check for interrupts. This is automatically done by the Ion-generated
// code. If an interrupt has been requested |cx.check()| aborts parallel
// execution.
//
// Transitive compilation:
//
// One of the challenges for parallel compilation is that we
// (currently) have to abort when we encounter an uncompiled script.
// Therefore, we try to compile everything that might be needed
// beforehand. The exact strategy is described in `ParallelDo::apply()`
// in ForkJoin.cpp, but at the highest level the idea is:
//
// 1. We maintain a flag on every script telling us if that script and
//    its transitive callees are believed to be compiled. If that flag
//    is set, we can skip the initial compilation.
// 2. Otherwise, we maintain a worklist that begins with the main
//    script. We compile it and then examine the generated parallel IonScript,
//    which will have a list of callees. We enqueue those. Some of these
//    compilations may take place off the main thread, in which case
//    we will run warmup iterations while we wait for them to complete.
// 3. If the warmup iterations finish all the work, we're done.
// 4. If compilations fail, we fallback to sequential.
// 5. Otherwise, we will try running in parallel once we're all done.
//
// Bailout tracing and recording:
//
// When a bailout occurs, we record a bit of state so that we can
// recover with grace. Each |ForkJoinContext| has a pointer to a
// |ParallelBailoutRecord| pre-allocated for this purpose. This
// structure is used to record the cause of the bailout, the JSScript
// which was executing, as well as the location in the source where
// the bailout occurred (in principle, we can record a full stack
// trace, but right now we only record the top-most frame). Note that
// the error location might not be in the same JSScript as the one
// which was executing due to inlining.
//
// Garbage collection, allocation, and write barriers:
//
// Code which executes on these parallel threads must be very careful
// with respect to garbage collection and allocation.  The typical
// allocation paths are UNSAFE in parallel code because they access
// shared state (the compartment's arena lists and so forth) without
// any synchronization.  They can also trigger GC in an ad-hoc way.
//
// To deal with this, the forkjoin code creates a distinct |Allocator|
// object for each worker, which is used as follows.
//
// In a non-generational setting you can access the appropriate
// allocator via the |ForkJoinContext| object that is provided to the
// callbacks.  Once the parallel execution is complete, all the
// objects found in these distinct |Allocator| are merged back into
// the main compartment lists and things proceed normally.  (If it is
// known that the result array contains no references then no merging
// is necessary.)
//
// In a generational setting there is a per-thread |ForkJoinNursery|
// in addition to the per-thread Allocator.  All "simple" objects
// (meaning they are reasonably small, can be copied, and have no
// complicated finalization semantics) are allocated in the nurseries;
// other objects are allocated directly in the threads' Allocators,
// which serve as the tenured areas for the threads.
//
// When a thread's nursery fills up it can be collected independently
// of the other threads' nurseries, and does not require any of the
// threads to bail out of the parallel section.  The nursery is
// copy-collected, and the expectation is that the survival rate will
// be very low and the collection will be very cheap.
//
// When the parallel execution is complete, and only if merging of the
// Allocators into the main compartment is necessary, then the live
// objects of the nurseries are copied into the respective Allocators,
// in parallel, before the merging takes place.
//
// In Ion-generated code, we will do allocation through the
// |ForkJoinNursery| or |Allocator| found in |ForkJoinContext| (which
// is obtained via TLS).
//
// No write barriers are emitted.  We permit writes to thread-local
// objects, and such writes can create cross-generational pointers or
// pointers that may interact with incremental GC.  However, the
// per-thread generational collector scans its entire tenured area on
// each minor collection, and we block upon entering a parallel
// section to ensure that any concurrent marking or incremental GC has
// completed.
//
// In the future, it should be possible to lift the restriction that
// we must block until incremental GC has completed. But we're not
// there yet.
//
// Load balancing (work stealing):
//
// The ForkJoin job is dynamically divided into a fixed number of slices,
// and is submitted for parallel execution in the pool. When the number
// of slices is big enough (typically greater than the number of workers
// in the pool) -and the workload is unbalanced- each worker thread
// will perform load balancing through work stealing. The number
// of slices is computed by the self-hosted function |ComputeNumSlices|
// and can be used to know how many slices will be executed by the
// runtime for an array of the given size.
//
// Current Limitations:
//
// - The API does not support recursive or nested use.  That is, the
//   JavaScript function given to |ForkJoin| should not itself invoke
//   |ForkJoin()|. Instead, use the intrinsic |InParallelSection()| to
//   check for recursive use and execute a sequential fallback.
