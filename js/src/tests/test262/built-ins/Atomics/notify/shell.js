/**
 * Timeout values used throughout the Atomics tests. All timeouts are specified in milliseconds.
 *
 * @property {number} yield Used for `$262.agent.tryYield`. Must not be used in other functions.
 * @property {number} small Used when agents will always timeout and `Atomics.wake` is not part
 *                          of the test semantics. Must be larger than `$262.agent.timeouts.yield`.
 * @property {number} long  Used when some agents may timeout and `Atomics.wake` is called on some
 *                          agents. The agents are required to wait and this needs to be observable
 *                          by the main thread.
 * @property {number} huge  Used when `Atomics.wake` is called on all waiting agents. The waiting
 *                          must not timeout. The agents are required to wait and this needs to be
 *                          observable by the main thread. All waiting agents must be woken by the
 *                          main thread.
