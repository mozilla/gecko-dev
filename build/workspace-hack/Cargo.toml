# This is a hack to help rust code in the tree that are built by different
# invocations of cargo share dependencies rather than rebuilding them. This is
# based on the "rustc-workspace-hack" used by the rustc build system to achieve
# the same. From the description of the issue given there:
#
#  "Each time Cargo runs a build it will re-resolve the dependency graph, "
#  "notably selecting different features sometimes for each build."
#
# We work around this by specifying the union of the set of features selected
# by dependencies in each cargo invocation for each instance they would differ.
