// allows you to signal the availability of work from any thread. All other
// methods are thread-hostile. Specifically:
// StartWork()/StopWork() should not be called concurrently with themselves or
// each other, and it is an error to call them while the worker is running on
// a different thread.

// (regardless of the thread), but you can call StopWork() in a subclass's
