This is a dummy configuration file to workaround the assumption of the grit
resource file being located here in the Chromium build toolchain.

This is only needed for our Android native tests to be able to include the
build/apk_test.gypi GYP file and depend on the
<(DEPTH)/testing/android/native_test.gyp:native_test_native_code target in
Chromium.
