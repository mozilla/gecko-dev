Bug 1224363 - Clamp seg_lvl also in abs-value mode - r=rillian

Even when the segment feature data is in absolute mode, it is still read as a
6-bit value with an added sign, so it could have values between -63 and +63.
Later, this signed value is used without checks as a filter level, which is
used to access an entry in an array of size MAX_LOOP_FILTER+1=64.

This patch just extends the existing clamping (that was done only to relative-
mode data) to absolute mode data, before it is blindly 'memset' in
lfi->lvl[seg][0], which was where the out-of-bound filter_value was read in
subsequent vp8_loop_filter_row_simple.
