// This class contains information about a thread that is only relevant while
// the profiler is running, for any threads (both alive and dead) whose thread
// name matches the "thread filter" in the current profiler run.
// ProfiledThreadData objects may be kept alive even after the thread is
// unregistered, as long as there is still data for that thread in the profiler
// buffer.
//
// Accesses to this class are protected by the profiler state lock.
//
// Created as soon as the following are true for the thread:
//  - The profiler is running, and
//  - the thread matches the profiler's thread filter, and
//  - the thread is registered with the profiler.
// So it gets created in response to either (1) the profiler being started (for
// an existing registered thread) or (2) the thread being registered (if the
// profiler is already running).
//
// The thread may be unregistered during the lifetime of ProfiledThreadData.
// If that happens, NotifyUnregistered() is called.
//
// This class is the right place to store buffer positions. Profiler buffer
// positions become invalid if the profiler buffer is destroyed, which happens
// when the profiler is stopped.
