# Native stackwalking is somewhat unreliable depending on the platform.
#
# We don't have frame pointers on macOS release and beta, so stack walking does not
# work. See Bug 1571216 for more details.
#
# Linux can be very unreliable when native stackwalking through JavaScript code.
# See Bug 1434402 for more details.
#
# For asan builds, there were many intermittents, and we're not getting much additional
# coverage there, so it's better to be a bit more reliable.
