        Keyboard Shortcuts
        ------------------

        When in the fuzzy finder interface, start typing to filter down the
        task list. Then use the following keyboard shortcuts to select tasks:

          accept: <enter>
          cancel: <ctrl-c> or <esc>
          cursor-up: <ctrl-k> or <up>
          cursor-down: <ctrl-j> or <down>
          toggle-select-down: <tab>
          toggle-select-up: <shift-tab>
          select-all: <ctrl-a>
          deselect-all: <ctrl-d>
          toggle-all: <ctrl-t>
          clear-input: <alt-bspace>

        There are many more shortcuts enabled by default, you can also define
        your own shortcuts by setting `--bind` in the $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
        environment variable. See `man fzf` for more info.

        Extended Search
        ---------------

        When typing in search terms, the following modifiers can be applied:

          'word: exact match (line must contain the literal string "word")
          ^word: exact prefix match (line must start with literal "word")
          word$: exact suffix match (line must end with literal "word")
          !word: exact negation match (line must not contain literal "word")
          'a | 'b: OR operator (joins two exact match operators together)

        For example:

          ^start 'exact | !ignore fuzzy end$

        Build options, platforms and regression tests may be selected
        using the usual try options (-b, -p and -u respectively). In
        addition, tests in a given directory may be automatically
        selected by passing that directory as a positional argument to the
        command. For example:

        mach try -b d -p linux64 dom testing/web-platform/tests/dom

        would schedule a try run for linux64 debug consisting of all
        tests under dom/ and testing/web-platform/tests/dom.

        Test selection using positional arguments is available for
        mochitests, reftests, xpcshell tests and web-platform-tests.

        Tests may be also filtered by passing --tag to the command,
        which will run only tests marked as having the specified
        tags e.g.

        mach try -b d -p win64 --tag media

        would run all tests tagged 'media' on Windows 64.

        If both positional arguments or tags and -u are supplied, the
        suites in -u will be run in full. Where tests are selected by
        positional argument they will be run in a single chunk.

        If no build option is selected, both debug and opt will be
        scheduled. If no platform is selected a default is taken from
        the AUTOTRY_PLATFORM_HINT environment variable, if set.

        The command requires either its own mercurial extension ("push-to-try",
        installable from mach vcs-setup) or a git repo using git-cinnabar
        (installable from mach vcs-setup --git).
