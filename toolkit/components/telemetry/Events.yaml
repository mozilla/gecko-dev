      Was the remote content successfully pulled?
      This uptake telemetry allows to monitor the behaviour of our clients when it comes
      to fetching data from remote servers. This helps defect-detection and allow observation of
      the proportion of success among clients and sources, the distribution of error causes, and
      its evolution over time.

      - uptake
    objects:
      - remotesettings

    extra_keys:
      source: >
        A label to distinguish what is being pulled or updated in the component (eg. recipe id,
        settings collection name, ...).
      trigger: >
        A label to distinguish what triggered the polling/fetching of remote content (eg. "broadcast",
        "timer", "forced", "manual")
      age: >
        The age of pulled data in seconds (ie. difference between publication time and fetch time).
      duration: >
        The duration of the synchronization process in milliseconds.

      eval() (or an eval()-like method) was called while running in the System Principal
      context or the Parent Process.
      Expected values are:
        chromeuri - chrome:// file
        resourceuri - resource:// file
        singlestring - A single file or string with no slashes
        mozillaextension - An extension claiming to be from *mozilla.org
        otherextension - Another extension not from Mozilla
        suspectedUserChromeJS - A filepath ending in .uc.js
        other - Unknown
        other-on-worker - We cannot do a regex; it is not chromeuri or resourceuri, but
                          could be any other.
        regexfailure - Our Regex Matching code threw an error
      The fileinfo key may contain additional information about the file that caused the eval()
      depending on the above value. Resource, Chrome, and SingleString will contain the full value.
      Extensions will contain the full value; however .xpi! will be shortened to !,
      shield.mozilla.org! to s! and mozilla.org! to m!.  UserChromeJS, Other, and Regexfailure should
      have no value.
