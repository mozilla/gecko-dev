"crash" ping
============

This ping is captured after the main Firefox process crashes, whether or not the crash report is submitted to crash-stats.mozilla.org. It includes non-identifying metadata about the crash.

The environment block that is sent with this ping varies: if Firefox was running long enough to record the environment block before the crash, then the environment at the time of the crash will be recorded and ``hasCrashEnvironment`` will be true. If Firefox crashed before the environment was recorded, ``hasCrashEnvironment`` will be false and the recorded environment will be the environment at time of submission.

The client ID is submitted with this ping.
