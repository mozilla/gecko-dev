      This records that a preference that was set by an experiment has

          Why the validation failed.

          This will be one of the following reasons:

          - "invalid-recipe": the recipe failed schema validation;
          - "invalid-branch": a branch value failed schema validation;
          - "l10n-missing-locale": the recipe is missing localizations for a
            specific locale;
          - "l10n-missing-entry": the recipe is missing specific localization
            entries for a specific locale;
        type: string
      branch:
        description: >
          If reason == invalid-branch, the branch that failed validation.
        type: string
      locale:
        description: >
          If reason == missing-locale, the locale that was missing from the
          localization table.
          If reason == missing-l10n-entry, the locale that was missing the
          localization entries.
