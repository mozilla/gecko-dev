// This file is responsible for keeping track of and managing the current point
// of execution when replaying an execution, and in allowing the process to
// rewind its state to an earlier point of execution.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Checkpoints Overview.
//
// Checkpoints are reached periodically by the main thread of a recording or
// replaying process. Checkpoints must be reached at consistent points between
// different executions of the recording. Currently they are taken after XPCOM
// initialization and every time compositor updates are performed. Each
// checkpoint has an ID, which monotonically increases during the execution.
// Checkpoints form a basis for identifying a particular point in execution,
// and in allowing replaying processes to rewind themselves.
//
// A subset of checkpoints are saved: the contents of each thread's stack is
// copied, along with enough information to restore the contents of heap memory
// at the checkpoint.
//
// Saved checkpoints are in part represented as diffs vs the following
// saved checkpoint. This requires some different handling for the most recent
// saved checkpoint (whose diff has not been computed) and earlier saved
// checkpoints. See MemorySnapshot.h and Thread.h for more on how saved
// checkpoints are represented.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Controlling a Replaying Process.
//
// 1. While performing the replay, execution proceeds until the main thread
//    hits either a breakpoint or a checkpoint.
//
// 2. The main thread then calls a hook (JS::replay::hooks.hitBreakpointReplay
//    or gAfterCheckpointHook), which may decide to pause the main thread and
//    give it a callback to invoke using PauseMainThreadAndInvokeCallback.
//
// 3. Now that the main thread is paused, the replay message loop thread
//    (see ChildIPC.h) can give it additional callbacks to invoke using
//    PauseMainThreadAndInvokeCallback.
//
// 4. These callbacks can inspect the paused state, diverge from the recording
//    by calling DivergeFromRecording, and eventually can unpause the main
//    thread and allow execution to resume by calling ResumeExecution
//    (if DivergeFromRecording was not called) or RestoreCheckpointAndResume.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Recording Divergence.
//
// Callbacks invoked while debugging (during step 3 of the above comment) might
// try to interact with the system, triggering thread events and attempting to
// replay behaviors that never occurred while recording.
//
// To allow these callbacks the freedom to operate without bringing down the
// entire replay, the DivergeFromRecording API is provided; see RecordReplay.h
// After this is called, some thread events will happen as if events were
// passed through, but other events that require interacting with the system
// will trigger an unhandled divergence from the recording via
// EnsureNotDivergedFromRecording, causing the process to rewind to the most
// recent saved checkpoint. The debugger will recognize this rewind and play
// back in a way that restores the state when DivergeFromRecording() was
// called, but without performing the later operation that triggered the
// rewind.
