// Memory Snapshots Overview.
//
// As described in ProcessRewind.h, some subset of the checkpoints which are
// reached during execution are saved, so that their state can be restored
// later. Memory snapshots are used to save and restore the contents of all
// heap memory: everything except thread stacks (see ThreadSnapshot.h for
// saving and restoring these) and untracked memory (which is not saved or
// restored, see ProcessRecordReplay.h).
//
// Each memory snapshot is a diff of the heap memory contents compared to the
// next one. See MemorySnapshot.cpp for how diffs are represented and computed.
//
// Rewinding must restore the exact contents of heap memory that existed when
// the target checkpoint was reached. Because of this, memory that is allocated
// at a point when a checkpoint is saved will never actually be returned to the
// system. We instead keep a set of free blocks that are unused at the current
// point of execution and are available to satisfy new allocations.

// Make sure that a block of memory in a fixed allocation is already allocated.
void CheckFixedMemory(void* aAddress, size_t aSize);

// After marking a block of memory in a fixed allocation as non-writable,
// restore writability to any dirty pages in the range.
void RestoreWritableFixedMemory(void* aAddress, size_t aSize);

// Allocate memory, trying to use a specific address if provided but only if
// it is free.
void* AllocateMemoryTryAddress(void* aAddress, size_t aSize, MemoryKind aKind);

// Note a range of memory that was just allocated from the system, and the
// kind of memory allocation that was performed.
void RegisterAllocatedMemory(void* aBaseAddress, size_t aSize,
                             MemoryKind aKind);

// Exclude a region of memory from snapshots, before the first checkpoint has
// been reached.
void AddInitialUntrackedMemoryRegion(uint8_t* aBase, size_t aSize);

// Return whether a range of memory is in a tracked region. This excludes
// memory that was allocated after the last checkpoint and is not write
// protected.

// tracked heap memory has been changed since the last saved checkpoint.

// When WANT_COUNTDOWN_THREAD is defined (see MemorySnapshot.cpp), set a count
// that, after a thread consumes it, causes the thread to report a fatal error.
