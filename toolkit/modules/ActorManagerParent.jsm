/**
 * This module implements logic for managing JavaScript actor instances bound to
 * message managers. It handles lazily instantiating those actors based on
 * DOM events, IPC messages, or observer notifications, and is meant to entirely
 * replace the existing concept of frame scripts.
 *
 * All actors must be registered in the parent process, before the first child
 * process starts. Once all actors have been registered, the actor data is
 * mangled into a form which can be handled efficiently during content process
 * startup, and shared with all content processes. Frame scripts in those
 * content processes attach that data to frame message managers via
 * ActorManagerChild, which handles instantiating and dispatching to those
 * actors as necessary.
 *
 *
 * Each actor is a class which lives in a JSM, and has a constructor which takes
 * a single message manager argument. Each actor may conceptually have both
 * Child and Parent variants, but only Child variants are currently implemented.
 * The parent and child variants live in separate JSMs, and have separate class
 * names, each of which have Child or Parent appended to their names, as
 * appropriate. For instance, the Browser actor has a child instance named
 * BrowserChild which lives in BrowserChild.jsm.
 *
 *
 * Actors are defined by calling ActorManagerParent.addActors, with an object
 * containing a property for each actor being defined, whose value is an object
 * describing how the actor should be loaded. That object may have the following
 * properties:
 *
 * - "child": The actor definition for the child side of the actor.
 *
 * Each "child" (or "parent", when it is implemented) actor definition may
 * contain the following properties:
 *
 * - "module": The URI from which the modules is loaded. This should be a
 *   resource: URI, ideally beginning with "resource://gre/actors/" or
 *   "resource:///actors/", with a filename matching the name of the actor for
 *   the given side. So, the child side of the Browser actor should live at
 *   "resource://gre/actors/BrowserChild.jsm".
 *
 * - "group": A group name which restricts the message managers to which this
 *   actor may be attached. This should match the "messagemanagergroup"
 *   attribute of a <browser> element. Frame scripts are responsible for
 *   attaching the appropriate actors to the appropriate browsers using
 *   ActorManagerChild.attach().
 *
 * - "events": An object containing a property for each event the actor will
 *   listen for, with an options object, as accepted by addEventListener, as its
 *   value. For each such property, an event listener will be added to the
 *   message manager[1] for the given event name, which delegates to the actor's
 *   handleEvent method.
 *
 * - "messages": An array of message manager message names. For each message
 *   name in the list, a message listener will be added to the frame message
 *   manager, and the messages it receives will be delegated to the actor's
 *   receiveMessage method.
 *
 * - "observers": An array of observer topics. A global observer will be added
 *   for each topic in the list, and observer notifications for it will be
 *   delegated to the actor's observe method. Note that observers are global in
 *   nature, and these notifications may therefore have nothing to do with the
 *   message manager the actor is bound to. The actor itself is responsible for
 *   filtering the notifications that apply to it.
 *
 *   These observers are automatically unregistered when the message manager is
 *   destroyed.
 *
 * - "matches": An array of URL match patterns (as accepted by the MatchPattern
 *   class in MatchPattern.webidl) which restrict which pages the actor may be
 *   instantiated for. If this is defined, the actor will only receive DOM
 *   events sent to windows which match this pattern, and will only receive
 *   message manager messages for frame message managers which are currently
 *   hosting a matching DOM window.
 *
 * - "allFrames": this modifies its behavior to allow it to match sub-frames
 *   as well as top-level frames. If "allFrames" is not specified, it will
 *   match only top-level frames.
 *
 * - "matchAboutBlank": If "matches" is specified, this modifies its behavior to
 *   allow it to match about:blank pages. See MozDocumentMatcher.webidl for more
 *   information.
 *
 * [1]: For actors which specify "matches" or "allFrames", the listener will be
 *      added to the DOM window rather than the frame message manager.
 *
 * If Fission is being simulated, and an actor needs to receive events from
 * sub-frames, it must use "allFrames".
