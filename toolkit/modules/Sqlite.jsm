/**
 * Handle on an opened SQLite database.
 *
 * This is essentially a glorified wrapper around mozIStorageConnection.
 * However, it offers some compelling advantages.
 *
 * The main functions on this type are `execute` and `executeCached`. These are
 * ultimately how all SQL statements are executed. It's worth explaining their
 * differences.
 *
 * `execute` is used to execute one-shot SQL statements. These are SQL
 * statements that are executed one time and then thrown away. They are useful
 * for dynamically generated SQL statements and clients who don't care about
 * performance (either their own or wasting resources in the overall
 * application). Because of the performance considerations, it is recommended
 * to avoid `execute` unless the statement you are executing will only be
 * executed once or seldomly.
 *
 * `executeCached` is used to execute a statement that will presumably be
 * executed multiple times. The statement is parsed once and stuffed away
 * inside the connection instance. Subsequent calls to `executeCached` will not
 * incur the overhead of creating a new statement object. This should be used
 * in preference to `execute` when a specific SQL statement will be executed
 * multiple times.
 *
 * Instances of this type are not meant to be created outside of this file.
 * Instead, first open an instance of `UnopenedSqliteConnection` and obtain
 * an instance of this type by calling `open`.
 *
 * FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
 *
 *   Ability to enqueue operations. Currently there can be race conditions,
 *   especially as far as transactions are concerned. It would be nice to have
 *   an enqueueOperation(func) API that serially executes passed functions.
 *
 *   Support for SAVEPOINT (named/nested transactions) might be useful.
 *

   *
   * If your SELECT statement could return many rows or rows with large amounts
   * of data, for performance reasons it is recommended to pass an `onRow`
   * handler. Otherwise, the buffering may consume unacceptable amounts of
   * resources.
   *
   * If a `StopIteration` is thrown during execution of an `onRow` handler,
   * the execution of the statement is immediately cancelled. Subsequent
   * rows will not be processed and no more `onRow` invocations will be made.
   * The promise is resolved immediately.
   *
   * If a non-`StopIteration` exception is thrown by the `onRow` handler, the
