# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-intro = { $hostname } uses an invalid security certificate.

cert-error-mitm-intro = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities.

cert-error-mitm-mozilla = { -brand-short-name } is backed by the non-profit Mozilla, which administers a completely open certificate authority (CA) store. The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.

cert-error-mitm-connection = { -brand-short-name } uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.

cert-error-trust-unknown-issuer-intro = Someone could be trying to impersonate the site and you should not continue.

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-trust-unknown-issuer = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust { $hostname } because its certificate issuer is unknown, the certificate is self-signed, or the server is not sending the correct intermediate certificates.

cert-error-trust-cert-invalid = The certificate is not trusted because it was issued by an invalid CA certificate.

cert-error-trust-untrusted-issuer = The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.

cert-error-trust-signature-algorithm-disabled = The certificate is not trusted because it was signed using a signature algorithm that was disabled because that algorithm is not secure.

cert-error-trust-expired-issuer = The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate has expired.

cert-error-trust-self-signed = The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.

cert-error-trust-symantec = Certificates issued by GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Symantec, Thawte, and VeriSign are no longer considered safe because these certificate authorities failed to follow security practices in the past.

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-trust-certificate-transparency = { -brand-short-name } doesn’t trust { $hostname } because it couldn’t prove it meets public certificate transparency requirements.

cert-error-untrusted-default = The certificate does not come from a trusted source.

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-domain-mismatch = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }.

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
#   $alt-name (string) - Alternate domain name for which the cert is valid.
cert-error-domain-mismatch-single = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for <a data-l10n-name="domain-mismatch-link">{ $alt-name }</a>.

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
#   $alt-name (string) - Alternate domain name for which the cert is valid.
cert-error-domain-mismatch-single-nolink = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for { $alt-name }.

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
#   $subject-alt-names (string) - Alternate domain names for which the cert is valid.
cert-error-domain-mismatch-multiple = Websites prove their identity via certificates. { -brand-short-name } does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for the following names: { $subject-alt-names }

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
#   $not-after-local-time (Date) - Certificate is not valid after this time.
cert-error-expired-now = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are valid for a set time period. The certificate for { $hostname } expired on { $not-after-local-time }.

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
#   $not-before-local-time (Date) - Certificate is not valid before this time.
cert-error-not-yet-valid-now = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are valid for a set time period. The certificate for { $hostname } will not be valid until { $not-before-local-time }.

# Variables:
#   $error (string) - NSS error code string that specifies type of cert error. e.g. unknown issuer, invalid cert, etc.
cert-error-code-prefix = Error code: { $error }

# Variables:

# Variables:
#   $hostname (string) - Hostname of the website with cert error.
cert-error-symantec-distrust-description = Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities. Most browsers no longer trust certificates issued by GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Symantec, Thawte, and VeriSign. { $hostname } uses a certificate from one of these authorities and so the website’s identity cannot be proven.

cert-error-symantec-distrust-admin = You may notify the website’s administrator about this problem.

cert-error-old-tls-version = This website might not support the TLS 1.2 protocol, which is the minimum version supported by { -brand-short-name }.

# Variables:
#   $hasHSTS (Boolean) - Indicates whether HSTS header is present.
cert-error-details-hsts-label = HTTP Strict Transport Security: { $hasHSTS }

# Variables:
#   $hasHPKP (Boolean) - Indicates whether HPKP header is present.

fp-certerror-bad-domain-why-dangerous-body = The site is set up to allow only secure connections, but there’s a problem with the site’s certificate. It’s possible that a bad actor is trying to impersonate the site. Sites use certificates issued by a certificate authority to prove they’re really who they say they are. { -brand-short-name } doesn’t trust this site because its certificate isn’t valid for { $hostname }. The certificate is only valid for: { $validHosts }.
# This string appears after the following string: "What can you do about it?" (fp-certerror-what-can-you-do)
fp-certerror-bad-domain-what-can-you-do-body = Probably nothing, since it’s likely there’s a problem with the site itself. Sites use certificates issued by a certificate authority to prove they’re really who they say they are. But if you’re on a corporate network, your support team may have more info. If you’re using antivirus software, try searching for potential conflicts or known issues.

fp-certerror-unknown-issuer-why-dangerous-body = There’s an issue with the site’s certificate. It’s possible that a bad actor is trying to impersonate the site. Sites use certificates issued by a certificate authority to prove they’re really who they say they are. { -brand-short-name } doesn’t trust this site because we can’t tell who issued the certificate, it’s self-signed, or the site isn’t sending intermediate certificates we trust.
# This string appears after the following string: "What can you do about it?" (fp-certerror-what-can-you-do)
fp-certerror-unknown-issuer-what-can-you-do-body = Probably nothing, since it’s likely there’s a problem with the site itself. But if you’re on a corporate network, your support team may have more info. If you’re using antivirus software, it may need to be configured to work with { -brand-short-name }.

# This string appears after the following string: "What makes the site look dangerous?" (fp-certerror-why-site-dangerous)
fp-certerror-self-signed-why-dangerous-body = Because there’s an issue with the site’s certificate. Sites use certificates issued by a certificate authority to prove they’re really who they say they are. This site’s certificate is self-signed. It wasn’t issued by a recognized certificate authority – so we don’t trust it by default.
# This string appears after the following string: "What can you do about it?" (fp-certerror-what-can-you-do)
fp-certerror-self-signed-what-can-you-do-body = Not much. It’s likely there’s a problem with the site itself.
