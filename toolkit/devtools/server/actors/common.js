 *     The BrowserRootActor or BrowserTabActor with which the new actors will
 *     be associated. It should support whatever API the |aFactories|
 *     constructor functions might be interested in, as it is passed to them.
 *     For the sake of CommonCreateExtraActors itself, it should have at least
 *     the following properties:
 *
 *     - _extraActors
 *        An object whose own property names are factory table (and packet)
 *        property names, and whose values are no-argument actor constructors,
 *        of the sort that one can add to an ActorPool.
 *
 *     - conn
 *        The DebuggerServerConnection in which the new actors will participate.
 *
 *     - actorID
 *        The actor's name, for use as the new actors' parentID.
