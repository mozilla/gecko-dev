  <h2 id="license-grants-and-conditions">2. License Grants and
  Conditions</h2>

  <h3 id="grants">2.1. Grants</h3>

  <p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
      modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
      Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
      part of a Larger Work; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
      for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
      Contributions or its Contributor Version.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="effective-date">2.2. Effective Date</h3>

  <p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
  become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes such Contribution.</p>

  <h3 id="limitations-on-grant-scope">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h3>

  <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
  this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
      or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      its Contributions.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
  or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
  notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>

  <h3 id="subsequent-licenses">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h3>

  <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
  (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
  under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>

  <h3 id="representation">2.5. Representation</h3>

  <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
  Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
  grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>

  <h3 id="fair-use">2.6. Fair Use</h3>

  <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
  applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
  equivalents.</p>

  <h3 id="conditions">2.7. Conditions</h3>

  <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
  in Section 2.1.</p>

  <h2 id="responsibilities">3. Responsibilities</h2>

  <h3 id="distribution-of-source-form">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h3>

  <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
  of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
  they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
  restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</p>

  <h3 id="distribution-of-executable-form">3.2. Distribution of Executable
  Form</h3>

  <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form
      by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the
      cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
      recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="distribution-of-a-larger-work">3.3. Distribution of a Larger
  Work</h3>

  <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
  with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
  Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
  You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
  such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
  their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
  either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>

  <h3 id="notices">3.4. Notices</h3>

  <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
  limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
  Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
  extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>

  <h3 id="application-of-additional-terms">3.5. Application of Additional
  Terms</h3>

  <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
  of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
  alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2 id="inability-to-comply-due-to-statute-or-regulation">4. Inability to
  Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h2>

  <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
  judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
  this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
  text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
  this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
  skill to be able to understand it.</p>

  <h2 id="termination">5. Termination</h2>

  <h3>5.1.</h3>

  <p>The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies
  You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time
  You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
  Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
  of the notice.</p>

  <h3>5.2.</h3>

  <p>If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
  and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
  all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
  shall terminate.</p>

  <h3>5.3.</h3>

  <p>In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

  <h2 id="disclaimer-of-warranty">6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>

  <p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
  without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
  including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
  of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
  is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
  You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
  part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under
  this License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>

  <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <p><em>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or
  anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to
  You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
  of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
  loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have
  been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
  liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
  resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
  prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
  limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
  limitation may not apply to You.</em></p>

  <h2 id="litigation">8. Litigation</h2>

  <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place
  of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
  in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
  counter-claims.</p>

  <h2 id="miscellaneous">9. Miscellaneous</h2>

  <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>

  <h2 id="versions-of-the-license">10. Versions of the License</h2>

  <h3 id="new-versions">10.1. New Versions</h3>

  <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.</p>

  <h3 id="effect-of-new-versions">10.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
</pre>

<h3><a id="SEC2">Preamble</a></h3>

<p>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</p>
<p>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
</p>
<p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
</p>
<p>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</p>
<p>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
</p>
<p>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
</p>
<p>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
</p>
<p>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
</p>
<p>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
</p>
<p>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
</p>
<p>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
</p>
<p>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
</p>

<h3><a id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>


<p>
<strong>0.</strong>
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p>
<p>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
</p>
<p>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
</p>
<p>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
</p>
<p>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
</p>
<p>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>a)</strong>
       The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
  <li><strong>b)</strong>
       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>

  <li><strong>c)</strong>
       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>

  <li><strong>d)</strong>
       If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
       <p>
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</p>
<p>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Library.
</p>
<p>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong>
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
</p>
<p>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
</p>
<p>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.</strong>
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
</p>
<p>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.</strong>
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</p>
<p>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</p>
<p>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</p>
<p>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.</strong>
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
</p>
<p>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
    including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
    distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
    executable linked with the Library, with the complete
    machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
    and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
    then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
    modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the
    contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
    be able to recompile the application to use the modified
    definitions.)</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
    for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that
    (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
    user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
    the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
    version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
    modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
    work was made with.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
    valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
    materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>

    <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
    offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
    access to copy the above specified materials from the same
    place.</li>

    <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
    a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
    a copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
</p>
<p>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
</p>
<p>
<strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
    of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
    library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of
    the Sections above.</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
    library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
    Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
    form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.</strong>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>10.</strong>
Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>11.</strong>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
</p>
<p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
</p>
<p>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p>
<p>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>12.</strong>
If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>13.</strong>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
</p>
<p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>14.</strong>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>15.</strong>
BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>
<p>
<strong>16.</strong>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

<h3><a id="section0">0. Additional Definitions</a></h3>

<p>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
Version&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

<h3><a id="section1">1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</a></h3>

<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

<h3><a id="section2">2. Conveying Modified Versions.</a></h3>

<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>

<li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="section3">3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</a></h3>

<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="section4">4. Combined Works.</a></h3>

<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>

<li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>

<li>d) Do one of the following:

<ul>
<li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.</li>

<li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="section5">5. Combined Libraries.</a></h3>

<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>

<li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="section6">6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</a></h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</p>

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
