        firstrun-skipped-default:
          A first run of a dedicated profiles build skipped over the old default
          profile and created a new profile.
        restart-claimed-default:

          old default profile to be the default for this install.
        restart-skipped-default:
          A first run of a dedicated profiles build after a restart skipped over
