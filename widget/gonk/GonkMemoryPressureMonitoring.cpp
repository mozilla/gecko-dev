/**
 * MemoryPressureWatcher watches sysfs from its own thread to notice when the
 * system is under memory pressure.  When we observe memory pressure, we use
 * MemoryPressureRunnable to notify observers that they should release memory.
 *
 * When the system is under memory pressure, we don't want to constantly fire
 * memory-pressure events.  So instead, we try to detect when sysfs indicates
 * that we're no longer under memory pressure, and only then start firing events
 * again.
 *
 * (This is a bit problematic because we can't poll() to detect when we're no
 * longer under memory pressure; instead we have to periodically read the sysfs
 * node.  If we remain under memory pressure for a long time, this means we'll
 * continue waking up to read from the node for a long time, potentially wasting
 * battery life.  Hopefully we don't hit this case in practice!  We write to
 * logcat each time we go around this loop so it's at least noticable.)
 *
 * Shutting down safely is a bit of a chore.  XPCOM won't shut down until all
 * threads exit, so we need to exit the Run() method below on shutdown.  But our
 * thread might be blocked in one of two situations: We might be poll()'ing the
 * sysfs node waiting for memory pressure to occur, or we might be asleep
 * waiting to read() the sysfs node to see if we're no longer under memory
 * pressure.
 *
 * To let us wake up from the poll(), we poll() not just the sysfs node but also
 * a pipe, which we write to on shutdown.  To let us wake up from sleeping
 * between read()s, we sleep by Wait()'ing on a monitor, which we notify on
 * shutdown.
