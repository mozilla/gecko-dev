# Reftests for downscaling
#
# Downscaling can be a lossy process, so a bit of mismatch is acceptable here,
# as long as it's barely noticable visually. When necessary, this can be
# explicitly allowed via 'fuzzy'/'fuzzy-if' annotations.
#
# IMPORTANT: For robustness, each test should be listed *twice* in this
# manifest -- once with the high quality downscaling pref disabled, and once
# with this pref enabled. The pref is set via "default-preferences", so
# simply appending a new test to the lists below each of those lines should be
# sufficient.
#
# Also note that Mac OS X has its own system-level downscaling algorithm, so
# tests here may need Mac-specific "fuzzy-if(cocoaWidget,...)" annotations.

# RUN TESTS WITH HIGH QUALITY DOWNSCALING DISABLED:
# =================================================
default-preferences pref(image.high_quality_downscaling.enabled,false)

fuzzy-if(cocoaWidget,106,31) == downscale-1.html downscale-1-ref.html


# RUN TESTS WITH HIGH QUALITY DOWNSCALING ENABLED:
# ================================================
# High-quality downscaling enabled:
