# webcam-simulacrum.mgif is a hand-edited file containing red.gif and blue.gif,
# concatenated together with the relevant headers for
# multipart/x-mixed-replace. Specifically, with the headers in
# webcam-simulacrum.mjpg^headers^, the web browser will get the following:
#
# HTTP 200 OK
# Content-Type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=BOUNDARYOMG
# 
# --BOUNDARYOMG\r\n
# Content-Type: image/gif\r\n
# \r\n
# <contents of red.gif> (no newline)
# --BOUNDARYOMG\r\n
# Content-Type: image/gif\r\n
# \r\n
# <contents of blue.gif> (no newline)
# --BOUNDARYOMG--\r\n
# 
# (The boundary is arbitrary, and just has to be defined as something that
# won't be in the text of the contents themselves. --$(boundary)\r\n means
# "Here is the beginning of a boundary," and --$(boundary)-- means "All done
# sending you parts.")
